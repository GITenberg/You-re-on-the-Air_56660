<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER 1</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Joe Carlin awoke. At once his mind, still partly drugged with sleep,
began to worm restlessly through a hungry channel.</p>

<p class='c010'>How did you go about getting on the air?</p>

<p class='c010'>His hand reached for a radio beside the bed. A station came in,
swelled, and filled the room with a crash of music.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Carlin protested from the floor below. “Joe! Do you have to
blast down the walls?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy turned down the volume. Wide awake, he sat on the side of the
bed.</p>

<p class='c010'>How did you become a radio actor?</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he remembered that this was Saturday. Nothing but orchestras,
and singing and the Woman’s Club program. Yesterday the <i>City Boy</i>
program, with Sonny Baker in the lead, had gone off the air for the
summer. He turned a button and the radio was still.</p>

<p class='c010'>In envious excitement his thoughts stayed with Sonny. Every Sunday on
the Crunchy Bread show, every Wednesday night on the Perfect-Burning
Coal program, and five times a week, Monday through Friday, with <i>City
Boy</i>. Two hundred dollars a week, easily. Last month the <i>Morning
Journal</i> had estimated that two hundred thousand listeners listened
to the <i>City Boy</i> show. Money and fame—there was a combination! And
Sonny Baker was only about eighteen years old.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My age,” said Joe Carlin, lacing his shoes. How had Sonny broken in?
How did anybody break into radio? How did you climb to the spot where
people watched a clock for your program and you earned two hundred
dollars a week?</p>

<p class='c010'>The photograph of Fancy Dan Carlin mocked him from the bureau. Fancy
Dan Carlin, actor. There the Fancy one was, rakish silk hat, jaunty
cane, immaculate tails, looking as though he might come dancing gaily
right out of the silver frame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess I’ve got show business in my blood, Uncle Dan,” Joe said,
and remembered a routine his uncle had taught him last summer. His feet
became sharp castanets against the bedroom floor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe sighed. He lifted a shirt from a chair and under it found part of
the costume he had worn in last night’s high-school play. He opened the
door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did Dad leave the <i>Journal</i>, Mother?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe came downstairs. “What kind of press did we get?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fancy Dan Carlin speaking,” Kate Carlin said plaintively. Suddenly
she began to laugh. There was something so rich, so special in her
laughter that, somehow, the boy laughed, too.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s show business talk, Mother. A show gets a good press or a bad
press.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re not in show business, Joe. Or must I remind you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy caught himself in time. He had almost blurted that he
intended to go into show business.</p>

<p class='c010'>A headline in the <i>Journal</i> said:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Joe Carlin Stars in Annual Hi Show</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Hunched in the breakfast nook, he read every word of the story: “An
audience of eight hundred that packed the Northend High School last
night—” What was eight hundred when Sonny Baker played to two hundred
thousand? He carried dishes to the sink and asked a tentative
question.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you think radio’s swell, Mother?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not when I get it for breakfast, dinner, and supper. Sometimes you
tune in for a noisy midnight snack.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mean dramatic sketches,” Joe said hastily. “Aren’t they
swell?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some of them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This, Joe thought, might represent encouraging progress. Perhaps this
was the moment, while his mother was in the mood to like something about
radio, to drop a hint of his plans.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some are pretty bad,” Mrs. Carlin added with conviction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well—some,” Joe said unhappily. Back in his room, after packing the
costume, he tried to give his tie a Fancy Dan Carlin touch—a tweak here,
a pinch there. The effect wouldn’t come. He came downstairs with the
costume in a box. How did you arrange for a radio audition?</p>

<p class='c010'>June roses bloomed on a trellis in the next-door yard, and the sky
was a June blue. All at once the courage and faith of young spring were
in Joe Carlin’s blood, and problems and perplexities were miraculously
gone. Why, no station could give you an audition unless it knew you
wanted an audition. It was as simple as that.</p>

<p class='c010'>The corridors of the high school, brisk and alive during school
hours, were shrouded to-day in Saturday darkness and gloom. Somewhere in
the building a janitor’s mop knocked against a wall and filled the
stillness with hollow echoes. Joe pulled at one of the great doors
leading to the auditorium. Instantly light and clamor burst upon
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>A girl shrieked, “There’s Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They all had <i>Journals</i>. A boy on the stage did some steps and
sang <i>sotto voce</i>. He paused with one leg back at an eccentric
angle. “I see you made the headlines, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A very dark, very intense girl said rapturously: “Joe, you were
perfect. Absolutely perfect. You ought to be an actor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy on the stage stopped his dance. “You’d give all the stars
something to worry about, Joe.” He sounded envious.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe wondered what they’d say if he told them, casually, that he
intended to be an actor. Soon he’d have to tell his father and his
mother. All at once his throat was dry.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Sears, teacher of English and faculty dramatic coach, checked his
costume. Mr. Sears was engulfed in costumes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who hasn’t turned in a plumed hat—a red hat? Who—Will you please
keep quiet?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The very dark, very intense girl rushed across the auditorium and
rushed back with a red plumed hat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe!” she cried. “You’re not going?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Something to do,” said Joe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Listen, feller,” called the boy on the stage. “We’re going to have a
jam session.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can’t,” said Joe. They’d had a good time last June, ad-libbing and
turning what had been a good show the night before into a travesty. But
last year he hadn’t been thinking of radio. He pushed open the
auditorium door and went through the darkened corridor.</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy on the stage snapped his fingers. “Mr. Joe Carlin,” he
announced, “has gone upstage”—which was a way of saying that Joe
Carlin’s head was starting to swell.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe caught a bus at the corner. Downtown, the streets, laid out
before the coming of the automobile, were entirely too narrow for modern
traffic. The bus, in spurts of progress, triumphed over one tight,
snarled intersection after another. Stores, stores, stores went past—a
parade of stores. The parade varied. Hotels with potted palms and
canopies, office buildings, Munson’s eight-story department store, the
banks. They crept past a store with a long black and gold sign above the
door and windows: LAW BLANKS—STATIONERY—BOOKS—OFFICE SUPPLIES. A
gold-lettered name on the window read: THOMAS CARLIN.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe dropped off at a stagnated corner and walked up Royal Street. The
luncheon-hour crowds jostled him, threw him out of step, got in his way.
His fascinated eyes never left a red neon sign running down the face of
a stone building:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>F</div>
      <div class='line'>K</div>
      <div class='line'>I</div>
      <div class='line'>P</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The building’s entrance was narrow. A loudspeaker in the hall rasped
out the station’s program of the moment. An elevator disgorged a group
of noisy musicians; a fat man with a cello had trouble worming his way
out through the door. The elevator shot upward, while its own speaker
continued the program.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fourth,” said Joe.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stepped out into a cheerful reception-room done in blue leather.
Here another speaker gave forth FKIP’s gift to the air waves. The
blonde, good-looking girl at the reception-desk smiled. “Back
again?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe managed an uncertain grin. People lounged on the blue leather
settees built out from the windows and the walls; people occupied the
scattered blue chairs. Too many people around to ask about
auditions.</p>

<p class='c010'>A man burst into the reception-room out of nowhere, made a sprint
across its length, and disappeared to the right toward the broadcasting
studios. The blonde girl glanced at the wall clock.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’d better step,” she said as if this were an everyday occurrence.
“He has twenty-two seconds.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The radio program signed off. Abruptly a new voice said: “Miss
America and what she’ll wear. Munson’s brings you to-morrow’s styles—”
The voice was somewhat breathless. Joe was sure the announcer was the
man who had raced through the reception-room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another elevator stopped, and a woman and three girls stepped out.
Nonchalantly swinging a gold chain, the woman marched off toward the
studios and limbered up her singing voice with complete unconcern. The
three girls stared after her in round-eyed wonder.</p>

<p class='c010'>The blonde receptionist laughed. The laugh seemed to insinuate that
everything connected with radio was slightly wacky.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe said an abashed: “Guess I’ll look around.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A turn to the right out of the reception-room brought him to a
corridor. Another speaker, set in the corridor wall, continued to tell
him what Miss America would wear. He pushed against a door marked:
<span class='sc'>Studios—Quiet—No Smoking</span>. The door closed on his heels.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now, for the first time since entering the FKIP Building, the
insistent blast of radio was gone. He stood in a soundless, glass-walled
visitors’ gallery that had broadcasting studios on either side. He knew
this gallery as he knew the hallway of his own home. Studio A, first on
the right, high-ceilinged and vast, for symphony concerts; Studio B, on
the left, for the song-birds of the air. Studio C.... Blue lights in a
square frame said: STUDIO C—REHEARSAL.</p>

<p class='c010'>He could look into Studio C, through the glass wall, upon a producer
and a cast. Not a sound came out to him. The producer, slouched in a
chair with his chin on his chest, leaped to his feet. His red hair was
wild; his eyes were wilder. He seemed to be playing out a whole scene,
and the cast, pencils out, furiously marked script. The rehearsal began
again, and the producer, back in his chair, held his head and rocked to
and fro. Then the cast must have hit what was wanted. There were smiles,
good humor, and a producer who no longer looked wild.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder,” Joe asked himself hungrily, “if I’ll ever be doing
that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Without warning another blue light burned in another frame. STUDIO
G—ON THE AIR.</p>

<p class='c010'>Curtains had been drawn and Studio G was blacked out. Joe’s heart
hammered. People were dropping their tasks and tuning in. North, south,
west—Boston, Washington, Pittsburgh. Perhaps lonely ships at sea to the
east on the lonely Atlantic. Six feet beyond the drawn curtains lay
mystery, the alluring secrecy of the unknown. Radio!</p>

<p class='c010'>The blue light burned steadily: STUDIO G—ON THE AIR.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d give my right arm,” Joe said hoarsely. There might not be so
many people in the reception-room now....</p>

<p class='c010'>The corridor speaker gave out a woman’s voice, hard, clipped,
metallic. Joe, recognizing the voice, knew that the <i>Years of
Danger</i> show was coming out of Studio G, with Lucille Borden in the
lead. Lucille Borden always played tough-girl parts. He’d heard her in
lots of shows. She must be another big money-maker, like Sonny.</p>

<p class='c010'>The reception-room was almost empty, and excitement stirred him. He
leaned across the reception desk. “I’d like to know—I mean, can you tell
me—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You write a letter to the Director of Auditions,” said the blonde
girl.</p>

<p class='c010'>Heat crawled up the boy’s neck.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ve seen so many. I always know. Tell them how old you are, where
you live, what experience you’ve had, what parts you’ve played, your
telephone—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe managed to say: “Only high-school plays. Northend High.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell them that.” The blonde girl took a sheet of paper from a
drawer. “Write it now. I’ll send it upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s hand felt like two hands, and the pen was hard to hold.
<i>Years of Danger</i> went off the air and was followed at once by an
oil company’s broadcast of a baseball game. An unnoticed base on balls
rode down with him in the elevator; an unimportant three-bagger fell on
deaf ears as he reached the street-level hall. He’d done it! He’d done
it! Passers-by craned their necks to look back at him. Embarrassed, he
lost himself in the Royal Street crowd.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a shock of awakening as he came to the store with
<span class='sc'>Thomas Carlin</span> on the window. Suppose—He stopped on the crowded
street and a man bumped into him from the rear. Suppose his father would
not hear of it? Well—He went on slowly to the store.</p>

<p class='c010'>Black gleaming show-cases ran up the center of the polished floor;
gleaming show-cases ran parallel with the two long walls. Immaculate
shelves held immaculate stock. Clerks, busy with customers, gave him a
swift, unobtrusive sign of greeting, and he wriggled his fingers in
return. He liked the store—its brisk quiet, its atmosphere of unhurried
alertness. He liked the flashing facets of light that glinted from the
chrome parts of typewriters; he liked the smell, pungent and sweet, of
ink and paper. He liked it all but—but not enough. Not the way he liked
radio. Not the way radio burned him up.</p>

<p class='c010'>A clerk carried a package toward the wrapping-counter. “How’s the
Thespian?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe grinned and moistened his lips. Suppose his father didn’t
understand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin was at the telephone in the compact rear office, and the
boy knew a moment of relief. At least he wouldn’t have to tell his
father at once. In the deserted book department, Frank Fairchild, his
father’s right-hand man, quietly checked through some papers. The book
department had always been something of a disappointment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hello, Joe.” The man calmly clipped the papers together. “Been
reading anything lately?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No time,” said Joe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A remarkably busy world,” Mr. Fairchild commented dryly. “Nobody has
time for reading. And yet here”—a sweep of his hand took in the
department—“here’s everything. Humor and pathos, the stories of great
nations and great men, drama, and poetry and essays. You can take a book
and travel to the end of the world. Romance and adventure. It’s all
here. Have people forgotten the magic land of books?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not remind them?” Joe asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c010'>A woman entered the department and Mr. Fairchild went forward to meet
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin called from the office. “I’m leaving in a half-hour. We
can go home together.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A half-hour meant a half-hour of respite. The boy’s mind drifted back
in excitement to FKIP, to the audition letter he had written, to the
unknown producer rehearsing in Studio B, to the <i>Years of Danger</i>
show. He thought of Mr. Fairchild and of books, and the two streams of
thought somehow drew together and mingled. An announcer’s voice,
breathless, echoed in his memory. “Munson’s brings you to-morrow’s
styles.” He began to tingle. Why couldn’t people be told about books,
too? Thomas Carlin presents—</p>

<p class='c010'>“All set, Joe,” his father said.</p>

<p class='c010'>The thought stayed with him while they took the car from a parking
lot and moved in crawls and spurts through the downtown traffic.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What was the talk with Fairchild, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Books. He isn’t satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We could do much better there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ve been thinking about that.” Joe was eager. “I have an
idea....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“An idea?” The man was pleased and interested. “We’ll talk it out
after we get home.” He swung to the left and passed a cruising taxi. “So
you’re beginning to think about the business. Fine! I’ve been counting
the days until you’ll come in with me. That name on the window will be
changed some day. Thomas Carlin and Son.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe swallowed. What a spot! He tried to talk.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy couldn’t swallow. He blurted: “I want to be an actor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin drove six blocks in silence and stopped at a red light.
Then he drove a mile in silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe sighed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The scent of roses mingled with the scent of newly cut grass as they
swung into the driveway. Still silent, the man stepped out of the car,
and Joe followed him to the porch. Mrs. Carlin sat there stirring a
pitcher of lemonade.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kate,” Tom Carlin said without preamble, “Joe’s told me he doesn’t
care to come into the store. He wants to be an actor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The stirring spoon was motionless. “An actor?” Kate Carlin said
faintly.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s voice was bitter. “I suppose Uncle Dan filled you full of
show business last summer. Are you planning to pack up and join
him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe stared. “I don’t want to be a hoofer. I want radio. We have five
stations here in town. Why should I go trouping?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well!” said Kate Carlin, relieved, and poured lemonade.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why radio?” the man demanded. “Why an actor at all?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe shook his head. “You get to thinking....” He didn’t finish.</p>

<p class='c010'>“About thousands tuning you in?” his mother asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was grateful. “You see it, Mother, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t,” Tom Carlin snapped. He put down the lemonade, untouched.
“Joe, I want you to think clearly. Sometimes Uncle Dan doesn’t come here
for two or three years. Why? He’s broke. Fancy Dan Carlin! If he doesn’t
come with fancy money, he doesn’t come at all. That’s show business.
You’re rolling in it to-day, and you’re down to a thin dime to-morrow.
Is that what you want?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s not radio,” said Joe stoutly. “I’m a nobody. If I got on a
fifteen-minute five-a-week show to-morrow they’d pay me twenty-one
dollars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A week?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A day. Six dollars an hour for rehearsal and fifteen dollars for the
show.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Carlin was incredulous. “Twenty-one dollars for less than two
hours’ work?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s the radio scale.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no arguing with an amazing twenty-one dollars a day. Tom
Carlin reached for his lemonade and drained the glass. His wife pushed
the pitcher across the porch table. He shook his head and turned the
empty glass around and around in his hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t want you to make a mistake, Joe. Show business has no roots.
Uncle Dan used to earn three hundred dollars a week as a vaudeville
performer; then came moving pictures and after that the talkies. What
became of most of the stars of the silent screen? Where are the band
leaders who were headliners ten years ago? Artie Shaw’s broken up his
band and gone out of business. He found it a health-breaking game. Don’t
you see how it works? Where are you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe said nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s no glamor in stationery. I don’t get fan mail. But if
something new comes out I’m not thrown into the street. I buy the new
merchandise. A shift in public taste doesn’t lay me away in moth-balls.
Don’t you see it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe saw it. But—He stared at the rose-trellis next door.</p>

<p class='c010'>The telephone rang and Mrs. Carlin answered. She did not come out
again. Tom Carlin stood up and walked toward the hall.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought: “I’m hurting him and I don’t want to.” He felt low and
mean. “Dad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin stopped.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was telling you about an idea....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What idea?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“About books. Mr. Fairchild calls it the magic land of books. Why
can’t we sell that? Make people think of books that way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Newspaper advertising?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“N—no. Tell it to them. Put some feeling into it. Make it live.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you by any chance suggesting radio?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Munson does it. He puts on a style show to sell women’s clothing. If
we could put on a sort of book show ... why couldn’t it be done with
books?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin held up his hand. “Thanks, Joe,” he said with finality,
“but one Carlin in radio is enough.” He went into the house.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER 2</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>On Tuesday, three days after he had written his application, Joe
Carlin received a letter from FKIP:</p>

<p class='c011'>We have arranged a dramatic audition for you on June 22 at 2:15
<span class='fss'>P.M.</span></p>

<p class='c012'>The reception clerk at the fourth floor desk will direct you to the
proper studio.</p>

<p class='c012'>Please bring with you to read for us two or three excerpts from
plays. The selections need not exceed fifteen or twenty lines in length
and should be varied in type.</p>

<p class='c013'>An everyday Joe Carlin, not expecting to hear from the studio for
several weeks, had taken the letter from the box on the porch. An
agitated Joe Carlin had noted the FKIP in the corner of the envelop. An
almost incoherent Joe Carlin burst into the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mother! A letter—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Joe.” She took it from his frantic hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s about an audition. A radio audition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s what it says. An audition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-morrow. An audition to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I understand that.” She shook him gently. “What are you going to
read?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh!” said the boy. Her calmness washed the incoherence out of him.
“I—I’m not sure,” he said and went upstairs. After that he paced his
room with a book. The sun passed over the front of the house and sent
long, slanting rays out of the west across the lawn. And still he
paced.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe!” his mother called. “Do radio actors bother with food?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He ate, spoke to two shadows who were his father and his mother, and
went upstairs again. At midnight, when Tom Carlin looked into the
bedroom, he found Joe standing in front of the mirror trying to achieve
gauntness by lengthening his face and sucking in his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m reading an Abe Lincoln part,” the boy croaked. “I’m getting in
the mood.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin closed the door and stared helplessly at his wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>Kate Carlin’s laugh was pure joy. “Don’t look so tragic, Tom. This is
priceless if it doesn’t become a pose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe managed a sizable breakfast next morning, but shrank from lunch.
He came downstairs with three books under his arm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shaky,” he said, his voice high and cracked. “Why should I be? Bing
Crosby, Jack Benny, Fred Allen—they all had to audition for the first
time. Why should I be shaky?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nonsense!” his mother told him. “I’ve seen you with the jitters
waiting for the curtain to go up on a high-school play.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He considered that. “You didn’t tell anybody I’m taking an audition?
Please don’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His mother watched him go down the street. “Tom,” she said, “I don’t
think we need to worry about pose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Cold panic gripped him on the bus. The parts he had read over and
over again last night seemed bloodless and thin. He tried to call them
up, to recreate them in his mind, but panic scrambled his thoughts. If
he was bad.... That’s what gave him the shakes. An audition either
started you off or stopped you right there.</p>

<p class='c010'>The blonde receptionist gave him a warming smile. “Your letter must
have caught them arranging an audition. Fifth floor, Studio K.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The fifth floor had none of the ornate trappings and blue leather of
the fourth floor reception-room. This was the part of the world of radio
that did not have to put on a display for the public. There was no
glass-walled gallery looking into glass-walled studios. Joe found
himself on a barren floor of unpretentious wooden doors, plastered,
roughly painted walls, and shabby corridors that led to hidden quarters
occupied by the mechanical departments and the engineers. A door almost
at the elevator had painted on it: <span class='sc'>Studio K</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the fifth floor was also FKIP. A speaker filled the barrenness
with “Miss America and what she’ll wear. Munson’s brings you to-morrow’s
styles.” ...</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe sat on a hard wooden bench. The loudspeaker went on and on, the
only sound, the only evidence of life on this floor. Once the elevator
stopped and a porter carried a kit of tools into one of the corridors.
The hard, lonely bench became harder, lonelier. Joe’s legs began to
shake and twitch. Ten minutes past two, and he was still alone in this
tomb of a fifth floor. So this was radio, was it? Two-fifteen. A
trickling river of sweat ran down his back.</p>

<p class='c010'>The elevator stopped again and two men and a girl stepped out. One of
the men was short and stout. The other was tall, lean, and brisk, with a
penciling of black mustache across his upper lip. The short stout man
took some keys from his pocket and they walked past the bench. The girl
said: “Only six scheduled for to-day.” They went into Studio K.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s heart gave a smothering thud.</p>

<p class='c010'>The door of the studio opened again. It was the girl. “Mr. Carlin?
This way, please.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s feet were lifeless, without feeling. Studio K might have been
any one of the smaller studios he had seen from the fourth-floor
gallery—same microphone, same chairs along the walls, same control-room
at the far end. Behind the glass front of the control-room sat the stout
man and the brisk man with the microscopic mustache. The girl joined
them, going into the little room through a door at the side. It seemed
to Joe that all three glared out at him with malice. He dropped two of
his books on a chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>The stout man spoke from the control-room through the two-way mike.
“What are you going to give us, Mr. Carlin?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A bit from—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The other side of the mike, please. You’re on the dead side.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A badly confused Joe Carlin crossed over. “A bit—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A little closer. Don’t be nervous.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Joe’s nerves were tight clamoring strings. He opened the book and
found his page. “Robert Sherwood’s <i>Abe Lincoln in Illinois</i>.” He
tried desperately for control. “Abe is at the cabin of Mentor, the
school-teacher. Mentor remarks that Abe seems to do a lot of thinking
about death. Abe replies—” Joe struggled to create a drawling twang:</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘I’ve had to, because it has always seemed
to be so close to me—always—as far back as
I can remember. When I was no higher than
this table, we buried my mother. The milksick
got her, poor creature. I helped Paw make
the coffin—whittled the pegs for it with my
own jackknife. We buried her in a timber
clearing beside my grandmother, old Betsy
Sparrow. I used to go there often and look at
the place—used to watch the deer running
over her grave with their little feet. I never
could kill a deer after that. One time I
catched hell from Paw because when he was
taking aim I knocked his gun up.’”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Joe closed his copy of the play.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the control-room the stout man said impatiently: “What does a kid
of his age know about death? Why do they come in here and try to read
stuff crammed with emotion? They’re not mature enough.” He pressed a
button and at once the two-way mike was open so that Joe could hear what
was said in the control-room. “Anything else, Mr. Carlin?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Deval’s <i>Tovarich</i>,” said Joe, “adapted by Mr. Sherwood.” This
was more like his own voice. He brought another book to the mike.
“Mikail and Tatiana, formerly chamberlain and lady-in-waiting at the
Russian court, are in Paris without a franc. Tatiana has suggested that
they go into domestic service as butler and housemaid. Mikail speaks in
excitement:</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘My sainted darling! I believe it is possible!
I see myself again, throwing open the
windows of the Imperial Palace and announcing:
“Majesty, there is snow”—and then, with
perfect grace, presenting belt and tunic to
Nicholas Alexandrovitch. And you doing the
fair hair of Her Imperial Highness, fetching
her gloves, telling poor Frederiks that her
Majesty will not be visible to-day. We were
good servants, Tatiana. We will be good servants
again! I must find my boots!’”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The stout man sighed and touched the button. “Haven’t you anything a
little more juvenile?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe said an uncertain: “Well—” Evidently he hadn’t been so hot. He
went over to the wall and brought back another book.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is he?” the brisk man with the thin mustache asked in the
control-room.</p>

<p class='c010'>John Dennis, director of programs for FKIP, shrugged.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was back at the mike. “A twenty-two-year-old boy has inherited a
factory. But he finds the factory closed as the result of a trade war. A
friendly old lawyer advises him to sell it for what he can get. The boy
speaks:</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘I inherited a property worth $35,000. Can
I get $35,000 for it? No. Why? Because one
man says I can’t have its value. One man says
he’ll leave me penniless if I try to create its
value. A dollar isn’t worth a dollar up here;
it’s only worth what Jake Grimmer says it’s
worth. I can’t swallow anything like that.
Maybe I’m a fool for not accepting $7,000 for
the plant and letting them short-change me
out of $28,000—$7,000 would be better than
nothing. But if I took that $7,000, for the rest
of my life I’d be licked. A shadow would be
walking at my side day and night and talking
to me. What about Eastport? Why had I let
them kick me out and refuse me what was
mine? Don’t you see, Mr. Graves? I wouldn’t
be selling the factory for $7,000. I’d be selling
my self-respect.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>In the control-room John Dennis said: “There you are, Amby. That was
much better: he wasn’t shooting at rôles out of his reach. A good voice
when he doesn’t strain it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ambrose Carver’s interest quickened. “Think he has something,
John?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have a show in mind. I may be able to use him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Carver became avid. “Is his letter here? What’s he ever done? Let
me get a line on him.” He read Joe’s letter rapidly.</p>

<p class='c010'>The program director touched the button. “Thank you, Mr. Carlin.”
That was all.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl came out of the little room of fate and led Joe to the door.
A middle-aged man now sat on the wooden bench. The girl said: “Mr.
Westfall? This way please.” The door of Studio K closed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe Carlin laid the three books on the wooden bench and mopped his
face. He was tired and weary, discouraged and whipped. You read a rôle,
and eyes glared at you from the control-room, and you didn’t have the
slightest idea whether you were good, bad or indifferent. Nobody
bothered to tell you. “Thank you, Mr. Carlin.” They might just as well
tell you to get out and let it go at that. Get out and let the next
victim come in. Didn’t they have any heart in radio? Didn’t they know
what an audition meant—the worry, the nervous, sick all-goneness, the
strain? Didn’t radio care?</p>

<p class='c010'>The door of Studio K opened with a hasty rattle of the knob. “Mr.
Carlin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe swung about.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man with the shadow of black mustache shook hands warmly. “I was
afraid you’d get away before I got out here. Congratulations. I wasn’t
surprised and John Dennis shouldn’t have been, either. That was the
stout man—director of programs. Great friend of mine, Dennis. I told him
you’d wow them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe knew an unbelievable, an incredible warmth. “You mean I was
good?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ambrose Carver don’t call them wrong. Last week I saw you at
Northend High in—in—” Mr. Carver snapped annoyed fingers. Why couldn’t
he remember that letter?</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe said eagerly: “<i>The Prince Laughs Last</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When you see shows, shows, shows, titles get away from you,” Amby
Carver said ruefully. A nice touch, he assured himself; just
matter-of-fact enough. “I spotted you before the first-act curtain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s lips parted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I came to tell Dennis to call you in for an audition and there was
your letter on his desk. I told him here was a kid he wasn’t going to
keep waiting; it had to be now. Well, wasn’t it? Weren’t you in there
to-day? That’s record speed for an audition. Ambrose Carver’s telling
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, Joe thought, he’d been in Studio K to-day—and all at once he was
living the bleakness of his discouraged walk back to the wooden bench.
“Did Mr. Dennis like me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He thinks you’re tops.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He didn’t say so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t know radio. They never say so. If they like you, some day
you may get a call. If they think you smell, you’re never sent for. Get
the picture?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe didn’t.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suppose you come in for an audition and Dennis says you’re
colossal.” Amby Carver was brisk. “Your father and mother tell the
neighbors—FKIP says you’re colossal. Down the street some family thinks
its daughter is colossal. They send her in, and all Dennis gives her is
a ‘Thank you.’ So what? Anybody can write that answer; that’s no
<i>Information, Please</i>. The girl’s mother, father, brothers,
sisters, aunts, uncles, and nieces all gang up on FKIP. Now do you see
why everybody gets a ‘Thank you’ and no more? Dennis steps softly and
keeps FKIP out of trouble. That’s radio.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The memory of heartache in Studio K was gone from Joe, and the warmth
in him grew and swelled. “Are you with FKIP?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well—not officially.” Amby Carver’s voice took on a vast tolerance.
“Why tie up with even a 50,000-watt station? Why cramp myself? I’m a
discoverer. Actors, singers, bands, script-writers, gag men—that’s my
field. Talent. I find it and market it. We all make money.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe caught it. “An agent?”</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the man’s hands made a flourish. “Mr. Carlin—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy said: “My name’s Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mine’s Amby. Let’s go where we’ll be more comfortable and talk
business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe gripped the books. He had read about agents and the part they
played in show business. No actor could get any place without an agent;
but no agent would bother with an actor unless the actor was good. His
head swam.</p>

<p class='c010'>They rode down to the lights and the ebb and flow of visitors, to the
cheerfulness and blue leather of the fourth floor. The receptionist
looked questioningly at Joe; he put his hands together and shook them.
The blonde seemed pleased. The loudspeaker gave them Lucille Borden
tough-girling through another episode of <i>Years of Danger</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby Carver led the way to one of the blue window-seats. “You’re
eighteen, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yeah.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How would you like me to handle you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe said a fervent: “What could be sweeter?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not much,” Amby admitted without hesitation. “When Ambrose Carver
says he’s putting a man over, that man’s over. You’re going to be a
headliner, Joe; I’ll have your name in lights. I’ll have you playing
coast-to-coast chain shows. I’ll—Is your father home nights?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Except Wednesdays. That’s bowling night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll drop in and see him to-night. About eight.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe couldn’t figure that. “What for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re a minor. I’ll bring a contract for your father to sign.
Everything open and above-board.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A real contract, legal and binding, with a real agent! Joe’s cup was
full.</p>

<p class='c010'>A man came like the wind from the glass-walled studio. Joe saw a wild
disorder of reddish hair, a tan raincoat trailing along the ground from
one arm, a brief-case only partly closed. Somebody cried “Vic!” and the
raincoat was jerked up from the ground. The hidden voice went on: “You
forgot that script.” A hand went into the brief-case, came out with a
mass of papers, and waved them impatiently. Somebody came running from
the direction of the glass-walled studios.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Know him?” Amby Carver asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe didn’t. “I saw him rehearsing a show.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then,” Mr. Carver said with brisk conviction, “you saw the best
producer in the city in action. That’s Vic Wylie. Great friend of mine.
Won’t work for any station—produces independently. A great pal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The producer was again on his way toward the elevators. His eyes were
the eyes of a man with fifty things to do and an hour to do them in.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby Carver’s voice throbbed with good fellowship. “Hi, Vic! How’s
the boy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Vic Wylie looked around, saw who had called the greeting, glanced at
Joe and back to Carver—and grunted. The elevator took him down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A great kidder,” Amby Carver said jovially. “A rich kidder. You’ve
got to understand a guy like Vic. Dramatizes himself. Gets up in the
morning and puts on a rôle with his collar. Plays it all day. I’ll bet
he’s doing a show with a hard heavy; he’ll be a Simon Legree until the
show’s in the bag. To-morrow, if he’s producing a Pollyanna, he’ll be
smiling like an angel and God-blessing everybody. A great guy. A great
pal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Another elevator carried them down. FKIP was now broadcasting
baseball from Chicago. The speaker in the car said: “Right over the
dish, but too low. Ball two.” The lobby speaker roared. “There it
goes—goes—and it’s gone. Mac hits into the right field bleachers—” They
passed out into Royal Street.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Amby,” said Joe, “are you Sonny’s agent?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sonny Baker?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby’s laugh rolled out, mellow and deep. “Joe, that’s funny. A great
friend of mine, Sonny, but you can’t stay in this agency racket on
friendship. You got to have winners. Also-rans don’t pay off.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But isn’t Sonny—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A winner? Momentarily, Joe; momentarily. He had no competition last
season. He happened to be the only available juvenile who had anything
on the ball. That happens in radio sometimes, when you get away from the
big broadcasting centers like New York, Chicago, and Hollywood. The
parts were there and he fell into them. One was a good, fat part. Next
season when he auditions for a show, he’ll find somebody named Joe
Carlin reading script.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The fat part,” said Joe, “was that in <i>City Boy</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That was it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You—” Joe had to wait a moment. “You think I’ll have a chance for
some parts?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A chance?” The agent rolled his eyes skyward. “You think Ambrose
Carver goes out to the Northend because he feels like taking a bus ride?
To-day you wouldn’t have a chance, but to-day isn’t September. By
September I’ll have had you under my wing for three months. You and
Sonny won’t belong in the same league. That’s how I do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s blood ran fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby Carver’s hand made a flourish. “Eight to-night, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe Carlin bought a <i>Journal</i> at the corner and waited for a
Northend bus. His brain built golden, gleaming air castles. Next
September he might have Sonny Baker’s fat part in <i>City Boy</i>. And
there’d be other shows, other parts. Or perhaps some new sponsor would
come along with a new five-a-week and he wouldn’t try out for the part
in <i>City Boy</i>. He felt sorry for Sonny. It would be tough to play a
part one season and lose it the next.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were plenty of empty seats on the bus. Money? Next fall he
ought to roll in money. He opened the <i>Journal</i> to the radio page.
A column of gossip and comment carried a short, routine paragraph:</p>

<p class='c014'>Sonny Baker, local radio star, left this morning
for the coast to play in summer stock.
There’s a whisper that Hollywood talent
scouts engineered the engagement.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hollywood? Talent scouts? That could mean only a possible
moving-picture contract. Perhaps another Mickey Rooney in the making.
Fame. The real money.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe Carlin thought in dizzy happiness: “And Amby says I’m going to be
a better actor than Sonny.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER 3</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Ambrose Carver, freshly shaved and barbered, sat in the Carlin
living-room and talked about Ambrose Carver. Tom Carlin held a cold pipe
between his teeth; Kate Carlin was quiet, non-committal. Joe thought in
dismay: “Dad won’t sign.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fifty per cent of all Joe earns until he’s twenty-one,” Tom Carlin
said bluntly, “seems like a lot of money.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Carlin,” Amby said earnestly, “you’re looking at this from the
wrong angle. I don’t mean I get Joe four stars overnight. I’m good; I
admit it. But I’m not that good. It takes time. Until I get Joe some
contracts, I make nothing. Does anybody work for you for nothing?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hardly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In show business the answer is ‘Yes.’ Show business is different. It
pays off different. You see, Mrs. Carlin?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Kate Carlin drawled: “Are you worth fifty per cent?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah!” said Amby briskly. “Now we are getting places. Without an agent
what happens to Joe? Who knows him? Is there any producer or casting
director who says: ‘Carlin was good in so-and-so; call him in’? No,
because Joe has never had a part. So he has to make the rounds of the
stations, day after day, round and round. He is not a radio actor; he is
a race-horse. But when I am his agent, I do the round and round. I keep
the directors remembering there is a Joe Carlin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe counted seconds of silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may have something there,” Kate Carlin admitted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ambrose Carver always has something there. Take another angle.
Without an agent Joe tries to sell himself where there is no market. One
station is foreign language; another has mostly spot commercials and
recordings. There’s nothing for Joe at these stations, but he doesn’t
know it. He finds it out in time. I save him all that time. For fifty
per cent he buys everything it has taken me years to learn. I save him
from mistakes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The silence lingered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby asked shrewdly: “Would it be worth money to be saved from
mistakes in your business, Mr. Carlin?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin cleared his throat. Joe waited anxiously. Nothing was
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Another mistake,” Amby went on, “is to think because Joe has a good
audition he’s a radio actor. He has to learn. Will a station teach him?
No. Not after he’s sixteen; they say eighteen is too late. They haven’t
time. So who rehearses him? I do. I worry for him, and think for him,
and plan for him. You know what radio stars get? You know what is paid
for the Eddie Cantor show?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t give Joe those ideas,” Mrs. Carlin said sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mustn’t he have a beginning?” Amby asked. He walked to the table and
laid a fountain pen beside the contracts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin glanced at his wife. Whatever he saw there sent his glance
to his son’s face. Slowly, after a moment, he picked up the pen.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here,” said Amby expansively, “is where we start to go.” He folded
one copy of the contract. Joe went with him to the porch.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin spoke in an undertone. “Why did you want me to sign?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You saw Joe’s face?” Kate Carlin was quiet. “He won’t wake up
to-morrow thinking we hanged him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A successful agent couldn’t waste time with buses. He’d have a
car.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Carver hasn’t fooled me, even though he’s dazzled Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But if he’s a bag of wind—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a short contract. When it terminates, Joe will still be Joe. Is
anything more important than that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Flushed and jubilant, Joe returned from the porch. “Thank you, Dad.”
Half-way up the stairs he paused. “Amby wants me to report at his office
at ten to-morrow for a rehearsal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is his office?” Mr. Carlin asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“McCoy Building.” Upstairs a door closed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One of the old, run-down rat-trap buildings,” the man said
slowly.</p>

<p class='c010'>But to Joe Carlin there was nothing dismaying about the McCoy
Building. The elevator creaked and groaned and finally reached the sixth
floor. Down at the end of a drab hall pale sunlight came in through a
smudged window, and motes of dust danced in the pallid shaft of light.
To Joe, the dust was a thrilling reminder of the dusty wings, and the
dusty drops and props of the stage of Northend High. Even the mustiness
of the hall brought memories of the damp brick wall at the rear of the
high school stage. Joe thought in fascination: “It smells the way an
agent’s building ought to smell—a stagey, theater smell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He tried the door of 615. The door was locked. He banged on the
panels.</p>

<p class='c010'>An elevator boy in shirt sleeves left his car and came to the bend in
the hall. “You looking for Carver? He telephoned downstairs to
wait.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe waited. The wait dragged. He paced the dusty hall, forgot himself
and leaned against the dusty wall, tried to see out through the dusty
window. At noon the elevator door complained harshly and Amby Carver
arrived.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sorry, Joe. Got tied up. Waiting long?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Two hours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Took me more than an hour to get John Royal long distance. You
know—Royal, N.B.C., New York. National Broadcasting. Great friend of
mine. Interested in one of my singers.” A key turned in the lock of
615.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What singer?” Joe asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby shook his head. “No can do, Joe. My pet superstition. Had a
baritone last year; thought I had him in the bag for five hundred
dollars a week; talked about it. Contract fell right out of the bag.
Don’t mention names anymore until a contract’s signed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The office was furnished with the bare essentials—desk, typewriter,
chairs, and a filing cabinet that looked second-hand. But what caught
and held Joe’s attention raptly was a microphone in a corner, probably
discarded by some studio.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bring it out,” said Amby. “I keep it around to get young talent
acclimated. Let them be around a mike long enough, even a dead mike, and
they’ll never get mike fright. Just one of my little tricks.” There had
been several letters pushed under the office door. The agent opened them
and became absorbed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe lifted the microphone to the center of the floor. The instrument
was unwired, unconnected, dead; and yet the feel of it, the look of it,
sent electric currents through his nerves. He lost himself completely in
its magic spell, and Amby’s shabby office faded and was gone. He began
to whisper bits from <i>The Prince Laughs Last</i>, feeling the part
again as he had felt it on the stage of Northend High. A door slammed
somewhere on the floor and Joe came back to the McCoy Building with a
start. Amby, delicately fingering the suspicion of a black mustache, was
staring at him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m coming in a door,” Amby said without preamble. “You greet me as
though you’re overjoyed to see me. All right; let me hear you. Remember,
you’re overjoyed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe tried to call up a mental picture of the scene. He cried with
ringing gaiety: “Amby! If I’m not glad—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no,” said Amby. “Just ‘Hello.’ And into the mike. You got to
talk, talk into the mike so that it becomes instinct.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe tried again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby’s finger tapped his upper lip. “Not quite overjoyed—just glad.
You do not like me when I come in. Give me a hate ‘Hello.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe spoke a thin, cold: “Hello.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Better. If you speak ten words and two are sour, you still have
eight words to put you over. But with only one word, it must be
everything on that one word. When you can do it with one word, you are
acting. Hate, scorn, love, doubt, fear: you do it all with one word.
‘Hello.’ You get me, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>This, Joe thought, was real coaching, coaching that went tirelessly
into minute details, the professional stuff. He said: “I get it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good.” Amby rubbed his hands together briskly. “You stand right
there at the mike and practise. Hello, hello, hello. All kinds of
hellos—pride, joy, dismay, surprise. Emotion all wrapped up in one word,
Joe. I’ll be back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe talked into a dead mike in an empty room. By and by it grew on
him that his stomach was empty. But if he left, the door would close on
a snap latch. Suppose he couldn’t get back? He tried for a greeting of
gaiety, the light touch. “Hello?” The steady echo of his voice in the
strange, empty room became appalling. Hunger and thirst finally drove
him out. He picked up a sandwich and a cup of coffee at the soda
fountain on the first floor of Munson’s department store.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby telephoned the Carlin home at six o’clock. “What time did you
leave?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s answer was short. “Quarter of four.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sore, Joe? Listen. Don’t get touchy on what you don’t understand.
Staying all alone at a mike is discipline. Mental discipline. Discipline
and concentration. I’ve been working for you. Got you an audition
date.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s soreness was gone. “Where?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“FFOM. You audition Friday afternoon. Two o’clock. See you
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What time, Amby?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby was silent a moment. “Better make it noon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe had to wait only ten minutes next day in the dusty hall of the
sixth floor. Amby was, as usual, a cyclone of brisk energy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Rushed to death, Joe. Got to arrange an audition for you at FWWO. We
won’t bother with the other two stations. Quick now on a pick-up from
yesterday. I come in a door. You’re a little surprised, a little amused
to see me. Give.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe caught a chuckling, good-natured, rising inflection.
“Hel—lo.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nice,” said Amby. “You’re learning.” He rummaged in a drawer of the
desk and brought out a script. “<i>City Boy</i>. You take Al Treacy,
Joe. That was Sonny Baker’s part. Always in front of the mike; don’t
forget. I’m due at FWWO.”</p>

<p class='c010'>How, Joe asked an empty office, could an agent coach you if he was
never around when you rehearsed? The question bothered him. Of course,
Amby knew what he was doing, but.... The “but” gave him his first
uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had never before seen a production script. Fascinated, he began to
read. Why, it had everything—dialogue, directions, sound. As he read
memory stirred and came alive. He’d heard this show. It must have been
two or three months ago. He turned back to the first page and there was
the date of production. March 18th. Of course!</p>

<p class='c010'>To-day he became lost again in glamour. He spoke lines as he
remembered Sonny Baker, the Al Treacy of the show, to have spoken them.
There was one scene toward the end.... He searched the script and found
what he wanted:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Sound—Closing of door.</span></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Al</span>: (Earnestly) Listen, Mister. I like you—</p>

<p class='c013'>Joe began to read the scene to a dead microphone:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Al</span>: Listen, Mister. I like you. I think you’re
all right. But this neighborhood can’t make you
out. It’s a friendly neighborhood; there’s a lot
of music, and singing, and loud talking and
visiting back and forth. You don’t talk much,
Mister. You don’t make friends. The neighborhood’s
beginning to whisper about you. They
say you’re not their kind. They say you’re
queer. Don’t you see? You got to snap out
of it....</p>

<p class='c013'>A clear, cool voice said: “Any idea when Amby’ll
be back?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe spun around. The door was open, and a slim,
dark-haired girl stood on threshold. He said: “Perhaps
in the next five minutes; perhaps not for hours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“An exact statement of an Amby schedule! I didn’t
know he was spreading out with an office boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe said stiffly: “I happen to be an actor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Poisoned catfish! Another one?” The girl stepped
inside the office. “Where do they all come from?
What have you been on?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing yet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What have you done?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“High-school shows.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And Carver picked you up? Next he’ll be lifting
them out of the cradle. A nice boy, Amby, if you like
them that way. Well, a part’s a part no matter where
it comes from. Tell him to list me in his file. The
name’s Lucille Borden.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe stared, stupefied. “Lucille Borden? You don’t
mean the Lucille Borden of <i>Years of Danger</i>. You
don’t sound—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m fed up, done, finished.” The girl’s voice was
hard and clipped, tough. She laughed. “Satisfied
now? What’s your name—or are you old enough to
have a name?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe Carlin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re nice, youngster. An unspoiled kid. That’s
a <i>City Boy</i> script you’re reading. I was in that show.
I was shot. I’m always getting shot, or stabbed, or
smashed up by automobiles. I end up every show
on a stretcher. Sometimes I think the script writers
are trying to kill me off. You were trying to read the
part the way Sonny Baker read it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was flattered. “Was I that good?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You were laying an egg. A pretty bad egg. Never
imitate anybody. Be yourself. Give the part Joe
Carlin. Well, don’t forget to tell Carver. The tramp
may find me a part.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She was gone, and Joe continued to stare at the
door through which she had passed. A real actress,
the first one he’d met face to face. Lucille Borden.
Why, she wasn’t tough and hard at all. Were all
actors and actresses so quick and generous with
help and advice? A glow, a pride that he was an
actor, too, ran through him. He turned to the mike
and read again. He tried to give the part Joe Carlin,
but all the days he had listened to Sonny Baker
got in the way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lucille Borden was here,” he told Amby when
the agent finally returned.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby tried to hide his surprise. “Lucille? See how
they’re starting to run to me, Joe? What did she
want?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A part if one turns up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ambrose Carver rubbed his hands briskly. “A great
girl, Lucille. One of my best friends. She thinks I’m
aces.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Impressions were beginning to register on Joe.
Everybody was one of Amby’s best friends. He said:
“How about that FFOM audition to-morrow? Are
you coaching me before I go to the studio?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby, in his desk chair, stretched out languidly.
“Give them what you gave FKIP. It was good enough
there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>On the way home Joe tried to understand what
was becoming a muddle. Didn’t your agent want
to see you get better and better? Why had Lucille
said: “A nice boy, Amby, if you like them that way.”
And there was another sentence she had used: “The
tramp may find me a part.” Why had she been so
caustic, so critical of Amby?</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby went with him to FFOM and sat in the control-room.
Station FFOM wasn’t quite in the same
class with Station FKIP. It was in a smaller, less
ostentatious building; there was no glittering reception-room
with leather chairs, there was no expensive
glass gallery. Joe went into a plain, small, matter-of-fact
studio and began to read. This time he carried
two plays to the mike so that, when he finished the
first, the control-room would not ask him if he had
anything else. He told himself: “They won’t know
I’m so green; they’ll think I’ve been around.” Finally
he gave them the juvenile bit.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, Mr. Carlin,” the control-room said.
That’s what he’d expected, that, and no more. He
was learning. Soon nobody’d have to tell him: “That’s
show business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby joined him. “Joe, you were terrific; better
than FKIP. You’re a knockout. Now you’re on file at
two stations. Don’t forget you audition at FWWO
Monday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What about to-morrow?” To-morrow was Saturday.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby’s hand caressed the thread of black mustache.
“A short day, Joe. Not worth your while coming
down.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe would have been glad to come down, if only
for a ten-minute rehearsal. Saturday, discontented
and restless, he lazed in his room and kept turning
the dial of his radio. Downstairs, the telephone rang.
He leaned over the banisters hoping that this was
for him and that Amby had changed his mind. But
the call was from his father.</p>

<p class='c010'>Kate Carlin brought a bulky envelop out into the
hall. “Dad brought these papers home last night and
forgot them this morning. Do you mind taking them
down?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the boy’s first visit to the store since the
day he had told his father he wanted to be an actor.
There was the same air of unhurried alertness, the
same quiet atmosphere of sureness and efficiency.
The typewriters had been moved back; the first of
the gleaming center-floor cases held a display of
cameras and snapshot enlargements. Every enlargement
showed a mountain, lake, or seashore scene.
With the vacation season almost at hand, trust to his
father, he thought, to know how to enhance the appeal
of a camera. And old pride, warm and swelling,
stirred in him; he had never been in another store
quite like this one.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin said: “You made good time. Stick
around and I’ll take you to lunch.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe wandered into the book department. And suddenly
a thought, forgotten since his last visit, was
back. A magic land of books that people had forgotten!
Why couldn’t their interest be aroused, awakened,
and quickened? Why couldn’t they be told in
such a way that they’d be eager to listen? Thomas
Carlin Presents To-day’s Book.... How? Anything
that went on the air had to be planned shrewdly and
knowingly. How and what?</p>

<p class='c010'>An undecided boy was in the book department,
and Mr. Fairchild was showing this small customer
the same deference he would have shown a collector
placing a large order. Pride stirred in Joe again—Thomas
Carlin service. The boy went out at last
with the tale he had selected. Joe’s mind still groped.
Thomas Carlin Presents.... How could it be done?
That it could be done he had no doubt. Thomas
Carlin Presents.... His father had said: “One Carlin
in radio is enough,” but that day his father had been
upset. Perhaps, since then....</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Fairchild, did Dad ever say anything to you
about pepping up the book department?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Something about radio, Joe? We talked it over.
Your suggestion, wasn’t it? Your father thought the
cost would be prohibitive. We’d have to sell six
hundred more books a week to get our money back.
That’s a lot of extra books.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was. And yet, if radio could sell clothing for
Munson.... “Perhaps, if I bring it up again—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t press your radio luck too far, Joe.” Mr. Fairchild’s
smile was shrewd.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought: “He knows I’m not in radio with
Dad’s blessing.” But his father had at least considered
the idea. He might have known that would happen.
He felt better. But he wasn’t, he thought
stubbornly, through with the idea.</p>

<p class='c010'>Monday afternoon he auditioned at FWWO. The
station was smaller than FFOM and loosely run;
the audition was called for two o’clock, but it was
three o’clock before he was brought into a studio.
Chairs and music stands had to be pushed away
from the mike. An impatient voice from the control-room
said: “Keep it within ten minutes, Mr.
Carlin.” Amby was not present.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe knew he gave a poor reading. Out in the street
he debated about going to the McCoy Building.
What was the use? Amby’s door would be locked.
He started for the bus stop at the corner, depressed.
FWWO had got on his nerves. The reading had been
worse than bad.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe! Joe Carlin!” Amby, elbowing and jostling,
came hurrying through the crowds of Royal Street.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe said: “I muffed it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“FWWO? Forget it. Does Ambrose Carver put
over his talent? Get an earful of this. FKIP’s cutting
a platter. You’re in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The flags outside the hotels along Royal Street
became gay, royal banners. The weight that had
come down on Joe’s heart at FWWO was gone. “A
good part, Amby?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A bit. It’s a bit show. <i>I Want Work!</i> FKIP hopes
to sell it to some sponsor as a good-will buy. People
out of work tell their stories. People who can give
them jobs write in or telephone. You’re a kid whose
father’s home with a busted leg. The furniture’s due
to be heaved into the street.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was puzzled. “I thought people in need of
work told their stories.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you get it? FKIP gets in touch with
churches and welfare organizations. Men and women
come in; script writers take their hard-luck stories
and put in the zing. A professional cast puts on the
show.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But people think they’re listening to—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The actual men and women who need the jobs?
Sure. That’s radio. Radio runs on a clock; a fifteen-minute
show is a fifteen-minute show. <i>We Want
Work</i> must be drama. How you getting drama out
of anybody you happen to bring in? How you going
to hold them down to fifteen minutes? Some
will want to talk all night; some will get mike
fright and won’t give. A professional cast has to
fake it. A real kid came in with the story you’ll
read.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So that, Joe thought, was how it was done. Something
else he’d learned about radio. “What time do
they want me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Two o’clock Wednesday. John Dennis’ office.
That’s the little fat man who auditioned you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Riding out to Northend Joe saw what Amby had
meant by “bit show.” Everybody in the cast would
have a short, terse part to read. He’d get on only
when some boy had a plea to make. Perhaps he
wouldn’t get on more than once or twice a month.
But rehearsals were six dollars an hour, or part of
an hour, and every show would be fifteen dollars.
Not bad. The bus dropped him off and he walked
rapidly toward home.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mother!” He was going to be calm about this.
“I have my first part. I’m in my first show.” Calmness
exploded. “Boy, do I feel grand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe!” The warmth of his mother’s understanding
made him feel even better. “How nice.” She led
him out to the breakfast nook to pie and a glass of
milk. While he ate he told her of how radio put
on its personal experience programs like <i>I Want
Work</i>, and about Lucille Borden, and about money.
Six dollars for rehearsals and fifteen dollars for the
show.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The day you go on the air,” Kate Carlin said
whimsically, “there’ll be no dinner prepared. I’ll
be too excited. Your father’ll probably have to come
home and cook himself an egg.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They laughed together. Joe thought, as he had
thought many times before, how easy it was to
laugh with his mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>John Dennis’ office was on the third floor of the
FKIP building, a small out-of-the-way sort of room
at the building’s rear. This third floor might have
been the fifth floor where Joe had auditioned in
Studio K. Given over to the pick-and-shovel work of
radio, the third floor spent no money for glitter
and blue leather. Four people, all talking at once,
were crowded into the office with Dennis; three
others, in the hall, walked about, bumped into each
other, and read script aloud.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Carlin.” Dennis tossed a script. “You’re Young
Mr. X.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lucille Borden said: “Hello, youngster. You
know these people?” She introduced him around.
He shook hands with Archie Munn, a tall, very
straight and very thin man with an amazingly deep
voice, and bowed to Stella Joyce, a small, bird-like
woman with a bird-like, fluttering way of talking.
The others of the cast of <i>I Want Work</i> were shadows.
He got away, out to the hall, and found his
part:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Announcer</span>: And now we’ll hear from
you, Mr. X—or should I say Young Mr. X?
How old are you?</p>

<p class='c017'>X: I’m fifteen.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Announcer</span>: And you’re looking for work?</p>

<p class='c017'>X: Not for myself—for my father. He’s
a tool-maker. Last winter he fell on the
ice and smashed up his leg. He hasn’t
worked since. It costs money to be sick
and his money’s gone. The doctor says he
can go back to work next week, but he has
no work. And now my mother’s sick—</p>

<p class='c013'>John Dennis and the all-talking-together cast went
past him. He closed the script.</p>

<p class='c010'>The parade ended on another part of the third
floor in a long, narrow room next to the press-radio
bureau. Somebody closed the door and the clatter
of the machines, bringing in news from all parts of
the world, was still. Dennis walked past a dead
rehearsal microphone and sat at a table. There was
a telephone on the table.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Twice around the mike,” said Dennis, “coming
in on the live end and passing out on the dead
end. Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It had all been written into the beginning of
the script. The cast came down upon the mike.
Voices implored:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Give me work! I must have something to do.
I want a job! My father needs work badly....”</p>

<p class='c010'>The second lap was completed. The announcer
swung in with his introduction. The show was on.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was, to Joe, an amazing rehearsal. Actors
walked to the mike as their bits came up, walked
away as they finished. Nobody, apparently, paid
any attention; nobody listened. When the telephone
rang and Dennis answered, the reading of parts
went right on. Those not at the mike conversed
in undertones. It was all haphazard, without order,
a sort of chaos.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll run through it again,” said Dennis. “Carlin,
not so fluent. You’re supposed to be a fifteen-year-old
kid. You’ve been brought into a studio to plead
for your father; you’re nervous. Stumble a bit.” Before
the cast could start another circle of the mike
the telephone rang. “Yes,” said Dennis. “I’ll be
right back.” He stood up. “Ten to-morrow morning,”
he said abruptly and hurried from the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lucille shrugged. “Well, that’s radio. We may have
to come back half a dozen times.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Why grumble, Joe reflected, if you earned six
dollars for each rehearsal? A new wonder grew on
him. In all the madcap confusion and lackadaisical
inattention of the rehearsal, John Dennis had heard
him read his part. Later, in the McCoy building, he
spoke of this to Amby.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s radio,” said the agent. “It’s like no other
business in the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Next morning, in the same room, the cast went
back to rehearsal. Dennis began to stop the reading
of lines, to coach for a different interpretation. But
the telephone still kept ringing; there was still, apparently,
a careless happy-go-lucky confusion. At
noon the director of programs called a halt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Four o’clock,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe had a sandwich with Amby at Munson’s soda
counter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eat here always when you’re downtown,” Amby
told him. “I hear Munson’s going in for a five-a-week
in the fall. He walks around the store a lot
watching business. Let him see us here. It doesn’t do
us any harm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It seemed to the boy a queer angle from which
to sell a radio show. But then, everything about
radio was a law unto itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>At four o’clock he was back at rehearsal. And
now, suddenly, all the light-hearted chaos was gone.
Dennis ran them through the show against the
watch. A minute and a half too long. Lines were
cut from the script, lines and more lines. This was
the never-ending, nerve-racking struggle of radio
to compress shows into time limits. Strain crept
into the room; Joe felt tension drag at his own
body. Another rehearsal, and they were forty seconds
over. More lines came out. They rehearsed
a third time. The eyes of John Dennis were glued
to a watch; a pencil hovered over the script, noting
minutes and seconds.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bingo!” he cried. “Fourteen minutes, leaving a
fat minute for the commercial plugs. Ten to-morrow.
A dress, and then we cut.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dress,” Joe knew, meant a dress rehearsal. The
dial in the tower of Munson’s department store
said seven o’clock. He clung to a strap in a crowded
Northend bus and felt drained. He was late for
dinner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tired?” his mother asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dead,” he said. “It takes it out of you. We
finish to-morrow. With rehearsals and the cutting
I ought to get about fifty dollars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For about eight hours of actual work,” his father
commented.</p>

<p class='c010'>Food had revived Joe. The thought of fifty dollars
didn’t make him feel any worse. He grinned.
“That’s radio, Dad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the morning the cast was through with the
narrow room off the press-radio bureau. Dennis led
them to Studio K. The dress was smooth. Just before
Joe stepped to the mike, Vic Wylie came into the
studio. His reddish hair was in disorder; his eyes
had their perpetual look of a man hard pressed for
time. He whispered to Dennis as Joe began to read;
he looked at Joe once, finished what he had to say
to Dennis, moved toward the door, and stopped. Joe
finished reading and left the mike.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vic Wylie said: “When you find time, kid, drop in
at my office. Something may turn up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All Joe could think of was what Amby had said:
“The best producer in the city.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the nose,” John Dennis cried. “Right to the
second.” The cast went to the mike, one by one, and
spoke a few words. A voice came back: “Too close.”
Joe looked at Archie Munn.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The engineer,” Archie said. “Leveling sound for
the platter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then they were ready. The cast lined up for its
circle of the mike. Dennis had his eyes on a watch;
one hand was raised. The hand fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nobody talked or whispered now. This was the
real thing. Joe’s part came up; he read from his script
and stepped away. The best producer in the city! The
best producer wanted to talk to him. Abruptly there
was silence. The show was made.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come along and hear it,” said Lucille Borden.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe followed the cast along a corridor to an engineer’s
room gleaming with bakelite—transformers,
switches, dials, knobs. Amby was there.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I picked it up here, Joe,” the agent said gleefully.
“You came in swell. You’re colossal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe grasped Amby’s arm. “Wylie wants to see me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby blinked. “Vic? Vic Wylie.” It dawned on
him; he recovered and beamed. “Great guy, Vic; one
of my best pals. I’ve been talking to him about you.
Didn’t I tell you the sky was the limit?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The engineer picked up the platter that had just
been cut. “You ought to sell this show,” he said to
John Dennis and set the platter on a turn-table. A
needle came down upon it gently. Words, uncanny
words, pleading and imploring, filled the room:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Give me work! I must have something to do. I
want a job! My father needs work badly....”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was stone, carved and motionless. It was coming
to his part. The announcer said: “And now we’ll
hear from you, Mr. X....” His own voice was in his
ears.</p>

<p class='c010'>He shook, and went hot and cold, and hot and
cold again. He saw Lucille watching him and tried to
stop shaking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ve all had the thrill,” Lucille whispered, “of
listening to our first platter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was over. His voice still rang in his ears. If he
could only go off some place, and sit down, and rest!
Radio certainly took it out of you; you earned what
you got. The cast was drifting around, breaking up.
He went out with Amby. He could still hear his
voice. After all, what difference did weariness make?
It passed away. And Vic Wylie wanted to talk to
him, and FKIP owed him about fifty dollars. The
fifty dollars was more than money. It was a symbol,
a promise for all the future. It meant that a radio
station thought he was a good enough actor to pay
money to.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Amby,” he said, “when do we get paid?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For what?” Amby was startled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The show.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This <i>I Want Work</i> show?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What other show did I work?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean money? You expect to get paid some
money?” Amby’s voice thinned to a squeak. “Where
do you think you are, New York?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought: “And I boasted to Dad....” Something
was wrong. He saw his agent staring at him,
gaping at him, and his heart drained. He was cold
again, and this wasn’t the kind of strange chill that
brought a thrill in its wake.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Listen, Amby.” Could this be the same voice that
had come off a platter? “I worked three days on that
show. Yesterday I started at ten and got through
at seven last night. Three hours yesterday afternoon
in one stretch. For what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you mean money—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t I get anything?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure, sure. Give me a chance to tell you. You,
Lucille, Archie—you all get something.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ambrose Carver said: “You get experience.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER 4</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“The name,” Joe Carlin said bitterly, “is sucker.
My name, Amby.” He knew now that he should have
asked what FKIP paid for cutting a platter. “I
shouldn’t have taken fifty dollars for granted.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ambrose Carver was aghast. “You expected fifty
dollars? Fifty?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t expect to work for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But fifty dollars....” Amby bleated in horror.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought there was big money in radio.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure there’s big money. Does Jack Benny work
for peanuts? Use your head. Does Edgar Bergen
work for three cheers? Does—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby mopped his face with an agitated hand.
“Wouldn’t I like to see you make a fortune? Don’t I
get half?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a fortune. Fifty dollars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what for?” Amby began to squeal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Didn’t I rehearse a show? Didn’t I cut a platter?
Isn’t there a scale?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did I say there wasn’t? But where? Here? You
think it’s here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly Joe was bewildered, uncertain. “What
does that mean, Amby?”</p>

<p class='c010'>And, just as suddenly, Amby put the agitated
handkerchief away and became brisk. “Joe, it’s time
somebody wised you up. We can’t talk on the street.
Let’s go to Munson’s.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Munson’s main floor fountain was three deep with
the lunch-hour rush. Eventually Amby spotted a
table for two.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look, Joe. At Hickville you pay a quarter to see
a movie. It costs you a buck to see that same movie
at the Music Hall, New York. Why? I’m telling you.
Because New York is New York. Big time. Tops.
Show business has only a few big-time spots—New
York, Chicago, Hollywood, and Los Angeles. That’s
where almost all the sponsored chain shows originate.
Sure there’s an established scale. But get this,
Joe: the scale’s only for New York, Chicago, and the
coast. Every place else is small time. In show business,
small time pays small time. That’s how it’s always
been.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s coffee cooled, unnoticed. Disillusionment
crushed him. “Suppose the <i>I Want Work</i> platter gets
a sponsor?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maybe you get five dollars; maybe three dollars.
It’s only a bit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What if I’m on a five-a-week sustaining?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing changes. It’s a sustaining show, isn’t it?
You get experience.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A nerve in Joe’s cheek twitched. “Isn’t that generous?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby pleaded. “Listen, Joe. Your curtain’s only
going up. Some day you crash the big time. Then
you wear diamonds. You stick with a good agent,
and he gets you big time. I’ve told you about John
Royal of N.B.C. A great friend of mine. A pal. When
I take you to New York, Royal listens.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take me to New York now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby gulped coffee. “Sure Royal listens. Because
he’s a great pal of mine he might give you a low-down.
He’d say: ‘Joe, you’re not ready; you need
more experience.’ So what? You’d come back here
where you could get experience. That’s why small-time
radio pays in experience; you can’t get it any
place else. Didn’t Colonel Stoopnagle come out of
an upstate New York station? Ambrose Carver’s
your agent, Joe, and Ambrose Carver’s telling you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suppose I go on a five-a-week commercial?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now you’re talking something else. That means
a sponsor. Five dollars a show.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s finger drew a slow diagram on the table.
“Sonny Baker was on a commercial five-a-week. He
also had two once-a-week commercials. How much
did he earn?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maybe thirty-five dollars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe stood up. “And he’s what the <i>Journal</i> calls a
local radio star. Lucille Borden and Archie Munn
have been around a long time. They worked to-day
for nothing. If that’s radio, you can have it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby’s hand went up to the foppish little mustache.
“You’re not quitting, Joe,” he said softly. “To-day
you cut your first platter. You heard the playback.
You’re not going to forget listening to your
own voice. Come back to FKIP.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To look around a studio; to see another mike.”
Amby picked up the check. “You’re not quitting,
Joe. You can’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy bit his lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My office,” Amby announced briskly. “About
noon to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Riding home on a Northend bus, Joe stared out
at passing corners and saw none of them. Amby was
right. It got into you. You took a beating and came
back for more.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe,” his mother drawled, “let me see what real
radio money looks like.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The truth had to be told. “We get paid only if a
show has a sponsor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin laid down his newspaper. “What’s
that? Didn’t you say there was a scale of twenty-one
dollars...?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mistake,” said Joe, expressionless. “The scale
is only for big-time stations. We take our pay in
experience.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Humph! I pay my clerks every Saturday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is radio,” said Joe, and went upstairs to
wash.</p>

<p class='c010'>Anger grew in the man. “Kate, I don’t like this.
Apparently the station gets a lot of entertainment
for nothing. I don’t like to see Joe exploited....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it exploitation,” Kate Carlin asked quietly, “or
a condition radio hasn’t yet solved? It must have
been a shock to him. He’s taking it well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sometimes,” Tom Carlin said at last, “I wonder
if you’re very wise or whether you’re spoiling him.”
He found Joe in the bathroom. “You may need a
little money,” he said, and handed his son five dollars.</p>

<p class='c010'>Emotion made Joe’s voice gruff. “Dad, you’re—you’re
tops.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Next morning some cash in his pocket raised his
spirits and youth’s eternal hope flowed in him again.
At noon he was on the sixth floor of the McCoy
Building. Amby’s office door was locked. To-day, instead
of waiting, he went back to the elevators.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Seen Carver?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Carver’s been in and gone out,” the operator told
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe went out, too. He had no heart to wait for
hours in the dusty hall—not so soon after yesterday.
July heat made the narrow streets sultry. He didn’t
want to go home, and neither did he want to make
a round of the studios. Not to-day. He thought of
Vic Wylie. Presently he was walking toward Royal
Street.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby had once pointed out the building in which
Wylie had offices. Joe found a line on the directory
board. VIC WYLIE PRODUCTIONS, 921. In the
outer office of 921 a young, rosy-cheeked stenographer
talked into a telephone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He didn’t say, Mr. Lake. I know he’s read the
script.” She looked at Joe. “Have you an appointment?”
Before Joe could speak the telephone rang
again. “Mr. Munn? Mr. Wylie would like you to
be here about four. Yes, to read a part.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe said: “Mr. Wylie asked me to come in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He won’t be here until about two,” the stenographer
told him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The telephone rang once more. The telephone
kept ringing. A young man came in and talked to the
stenographer about a script. He was, Joe thought,
the Mr. Lake who had telephoned earlier.</p>

<p class='c010'>And then the door of 921 flew open and Vic Wylie
arrived. “Did Munn call, Miss Robb?” He charged
for the inner office, swinging the inevitable brief-case,
and saw Joe. “With you in a minute.” He saw
the other man. “A good script, Curt, but I can’t find
a spot for it. Take it to New York and show it to
Kate Smith’s agency. Now and then her show
emotes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What would it pay?” Curt Lake asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fifteen minutes on a Kate Smith? About two
hundred and fifty dollars.” The door of the inner
office closed upon Wylie and the script writer.</p>

<p class='c010'>An intangible flavor of show business lingered in
the outer office, and words echoed in Joe’s mind.
Script—two hundred and fifty dollars—Kate Smith—emote.
Emote meant, of course, that the Kate Smith
show occasionally used a highly emotional sketch.
There had never been talk like this in Amby’s office.
Joe thought with a thrill: “This <i>is</i> radio.” What did
Wylie want with him? The inner door opened, and
his heart began to throb.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No more scripts,” Wylie told Curt Lake with decision.
“If Munson can’t make up his mind about
the show after reading ten, he’ll still be yes and no
if he reads fifty. If he yells for more, we’ll shoot him
a synopsis.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lake was gone, and Wylie was at the desk of
Miss Robb. His finger snapped.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Telegram. Thompson, Chicago. <i>The Wings in the
Sky</i> platter goes air-mail. See that it makes the three
o’clock plane.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The three o’clock plane,” the stenographer repeated.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie stood lost in frowning thought. Abruptly he
motioned to Joe and was on his way back to the
inner office.</p>

<p class='c010'>Six words went around and around in Joe’s head:
“The best producer in the city.” His heart was a
hammer. Following Wylie, he found himself in the
strangest room he had ever seen, a room that spoke
of a preoccupation which brushed aside as trivial
matters that would have been important to other
men. A wide flat desk, that must at one time have
been beautiful, was charred with hundreds of black
scars as though an absorbed man had carelessly laid
down lighted cigarettes and then forgotten them.
There was a disordered stack of papers, probably
scripts. There was a lustrous radio as badly cigarette-burned
as the desk. There were dozens of photographs
on the walls—autographed photographs of
men and women who were important in radio, in
Hollywood, and on the stage. The cushions of chairs
and of a settee, badly scuffed and lumped out of
shape, suggested long hours of feverish argument
when comfort was ignored. But strangest of all was
the absence of what had been the highlight of
Amby’s office, a dead, unwired, rehearsal microphone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Or was it, Joe wondered, so very strange?</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie, from a swivel chair behind the desk, shot
out a command. “Give me your background.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eighteen,” said Joe. “High-school graduate. Four
years in high-school plays. Made the cast my first
year.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you’ve decided you’re an actor?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know. I hope I am.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anybody in show business give you any encouragement?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ambrose Carver. He’d heard about me and came
to Northend High for the June play. He told FKIP
to call me in for an immediate audition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who gave you that story? Carver? Is he your
agent?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Written contract or verbal agreement?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My father signed a contract.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All nicely poisoned with legality.” Wylie’s voice
was acid. He swung around in the chair and sat
with his back to the room, nervously tense. Abruptly
he swung back as though jerked by invisible wires.
“I’m giving you a chance at something that may
never happen. Munson’s store wants a serial. That’s
no secret; everybody in radio knows it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wonder was sharp in Joe. Was that why Amby
had known, because everybody else had known?</p>

<p class='c010'>The producer went on in a nervous rush of words.
“The Everts-Hall Agency has the Munson account.
They haven’t been able to come up with a show
Munson’ll O.K. We’re giving it a whirl. We have
our own ideas about the kind of show Munson
should have. A heroine for the lead because a department
store sells mostly to women. A widow fighting
to give her son a chance in life. <i>Sue Davis Against
the World</i>. You’re Dick Davis, the son. You’re fifteen.
You want to get out of school and help.” Wylie tossed
a script across the desk. “Page four. Read me the
speech beginning ‘Mother, don’t shake your head....’”
The chair swung again and the man’s back was
to the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe Carlin found the place. Joe Carlin, who was
becoming a veteran, who had had three station auditions,
who had rehearsed a show and cut a platter
for FKIP began to read:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Dick</span>: Mother, don’t shake—</p>

<p class='c013'>The chair spun around. “Mo—ther!” The voice that
came out of the chair had a mocking, infantile bleat.
Startled, Joe stopped.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mo—ther!” Vic Wylie’s frantic hands were in his
reddish hair. “You’re not a five-year-old brat whining
for a lollypop. You’re fifteen. You feel you’re a man.
You’re suddenly aware that the most wonderful
woman in the world is fighting a hard battle. You
want to help. Put that into your voice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe tried again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no. Not ‘Mo—ther’ with a valley between the
two syllables. That’s the way a young child pules.
You’re fifteen. You feel that you ought to be the
man of the family. You’re long past the ‘Mo—ther’
stage.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe put snap into it. “Mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie groaned. “Too abrupt; too cold. You’ve got
to get that ‘Mother’ with a depth, a feeling.... Try
it again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe drew a breath. “Mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now you’re swinging back to the cute stage.
Something in between the two. Get it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A shaken Joe Carlin obeyed the will of an inexorable
taskmaster. Sweat beaded his upper lip; sweat
ran down his cheeks. For fifteen minutes he struggled
to put into one word what a slave-driver wanted put
into that one word. Then Wylie snapped his fingers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Carry that last ‘Mother’ in your ear. That’s the
inflection I want. Give me the rest of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Sweat dropped on page four of the script. Joe
read:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Dick</span>: Mother, don’t shake your head at me
like that. You must listen to me. I’m not trying
to duck out of high school. I can get through
at night. I can get college at night. Oh, I know
fellows talk about night study and never get
to it. But I know what you’re trying to do for
me. Mother, I won’t let you down. But I can’t
get it your way. How long would it take me
to become a doctor? Ten years? What would
I be doing for those ten years, living off you?
Letting you hustle off every morning to a job?
A man can’t let a woman support him like
this if he’s strong enough to handle a job.
Don’t you see, Mother?</p>

<p class='c013'>Wylie leaped from his chair. “I’m your audience
this minute and I see nothing. No picture, no emotion.
You give me nothing. Nothing but words. You
don’t act. You read. Anybody can read.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe Carlin sighed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can’t you feel the scene? Can’t you see it? Are
you a stick?” The producer appeared to be on the
verge of horrified tears. “Take eight words: ‘A man
can’t let a woman support him—’ Delicious. Remember,
this is from a fifteen-year-old boy. Delicious
comedy. But it’s comedy touched with pathos, and
the high courage of youth, and the glorious dreams
of the young. This boy must speak as a man. Doesn’t
he call himself a man? A man’s speech with the boy
showing through. Act it. Live it. The man with the
boy showing through. Sir Galahad in knickers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was desperate. “If you’ll give me time, Mr.
Wylie—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Time,” the producer groaned. “There’s never
enough time in radio.” He went back to his chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was picked apart. Sometimes it was a word,
sometimes a phrase, sometimes a complete sentence.
Wylie became a wild-eyed, goading fiend.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Robb knocked on the door. “Mr. Munn, Mr.
Wylie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Vic Wylie looked at Joe broodingly. “You’re only
a kid. I must forget that. I must sweat you until you
give me what I want. If you can’t stand the sweating,
don’t come back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll be back,” said Joe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Make it the early afternoon. I may be able to give
you a half-hour; I may not be able to give you a
minute.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll be back,” said Joe a second time. In the outer
office Archie Munn, tall and thin, chatted with the
stenographer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hello, Joe. Reading a part for Vic?” The actor
studied the boy’s face. “When he gets through with
you, you’ll have something.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought wearily: “I’ll have nervous prostration.”
A cup of coffee at Munson’s began to revive
him. Excitement stirred. At least, when you rehearsed
with Wylie, you rehearsed. There was no
hocus-pocus in a deserted office with a dead microphone.
You sweated and you panted, and there were
moments when you hated Wylie. But you were learning
every minute. And, strangely, you looked forward
with a kind of eager hunger to what would
happen next.</p>

<p class='c010'>With Amby, nothing ever happened. Joe thought:
“I’ll have to tell him.” He walked to the public telephone
booth in the rear of Munson’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why didn’t you wait?” Amby chided him briskly.
“I came in only a minute or two after you left.
Where’d you go?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was still learning. When you kept an appointment
at Wylie’s office, Wylie would be there. He
might not be able to see you, but you knew that in
advance. You wouldn’t wait and wait in a dusty
hall. He said coldly: “I went to see Wylie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s exactly where I was going to send you.
What did he want?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m reading a part.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vic didn’t tell me that. One of my best friends;
I guess he wanted to surprise me. A great pal. What
show?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Munson’s.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby became excited. “Didn’t I call the turn on
that? Look, Joe, that’s big. Munson’s tops. He buys
plenty of radio time; he spends plenty of money.
You didn’t go begging Wylie for a job; he came
looking for you. He wants you on that show. That
puts you in the driver’s seat. Tell him you want ten
dollars a show.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe had few illusions left concerning Ambrose
Carver. “Are you still my agent? I thought agents
handled salary demands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby coughed. “I’m pretty busy, Joe. As soon as I
get around to it—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure,” said Joe, “you’ll tell Wylie.” He hung up.</p>

<p class='c010'>A new day colored yesterday and softened it and
made yesterday’s sweating agony yesterday’s romance.
Joe counted impatient hours until it was time
to walk into Vic Wylie’s office. Miss Robb, the stenographer,
greeted him as one had been admitted to an
inner circle. Tall, thin Archie Munn cast aside a copy
of <i>Variety</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s Vic got you reading, Joe, the Munson
show? Dick Davis? A fat part. Lucille Borden auditioned
for Sue Davis. No dice. Vic’s giving the part
to Stella Joyce. You remember her. She worked the
<i>I Want Work</i> platter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe remembered the small, bird-like woman with
the fluttering, bird-like voice. “What was the matter
with Lucille?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Too much on the Tug-Boat Annie side. The script
makes Sue Davis the self-sacrificing mother type. The
part wants sweetness and light. Stella fits. That’s the
curse of show business, Joe; you get typed, and that’s
the only way they want you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought: “What’s the difference so long as they
want you?” The telephone was never still for long.
He tried to concentrate on yesterday’s rehearsal, to
run lines through his mind, but the closed inner door
proved a disturbing fascination. Every time that door
opened, Wylie’s quick, nervous voice reached the
outer office with some talk of radio.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Another year of sitting hour after hour in producers’
offices,” Archie Munn’s deep voice rumbled,
“and they’ll stick pins in me to see if I’m alive.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Show business throbbed through the rooms like a
living pulse. Somebody came in from FKIP and
passed inside. Somebody else arrived whom Joe remembered
having seen at FFOM. Two girls walked
in and talked to Miss Robb. They were singers, Joe
gathered; a sister act; part of a road company that
had disbanded. Miss Robb explained that Wylie produced
only radio dramatic sketches and eased them
out. Then a beefy, red-faced man was with them.
“Howdy, folks, howdy,” he called and joined Wylie
in the inner room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Archie Munn, sitting on his spine in a chair tilted
against the wall, pulled in his long legs. “Tony Vaux,
Joe. If we’re lucky, we’ll see a lot of that boy. Head
of Everts-Hall’s radio department. Munson’s agency.
If <i>Sue Davis Against the World</i> goes on the air he’ll
be handing us our checks every week.” The actor
glanced at his watch. “Four-thirty. Three and a half
hours is long enough to sit in any producer’s chair.
Be seeing you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe continued to wait. At five o’clock Miss Robb
put on her hat and opened the inner door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good night, Mr. Wylie. Mr. Carlin’s still waiting.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie, disheveled and harassed, popped through
the door. “Couldn’t get to you; tied up. Eating downtown?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe nodded. “I could.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie popped back and closed the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s his way of telling you to wait,” Miss Robb
smiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was seven o’clock before the door opened again
to let genial Tony Vaux out. Vic Wylie cried in a
temper: “When it comes to radio, I’m boss. Tell that
to Munson. I don’t handle plopperoos.” A motion of
the brief-case swept Joe toward the hall and the elevators.
The two soon found themselves at the farthest
table of a restaurant off Royal Street.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie’s elbows were on the table; his hands ravaged
his hair. “Love,” he groaned. “A two o’clock
love serial. The air lousy with love shows in the
afternoon and Munson wants to toss in another one.
A sure plopperoo.” A waitress set down rolls and
butter, and the producer looked up. His eyes cleared.
“You’ll get used to me talking to myself,” he said to
Joe and broke a roll.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe burned with curiosity. “Why does Munson
want another show? He’s got <i>Miss America and What
She’ll Wear</i>....”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie jabbed a wad of roll into his mouth. “That’s
going off.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But all the women in our end of town—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We know the ratings, kid; we can tell you just
how many listeners the show grabs. But it isn’t bringing
Munson business. A sponsored show is advertising.
It must produce. Not only listeners—business.
If it doesn’t bring in the boxtops, it lays an egg.
That’s radio.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Learning, Joe thought; learning every day. And
then his thoughts were back in the book department
of his father’s store. Thomas Carlin Presents.... He
had based so much on the Munson show! Something
in him crystallized to conviction. Clothing was only
clothing, but books were romance and adventure.
You could always sell romance and adventure. There
was only one question—how?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Wylie, why does one show bring in the boxtops
while another show fails?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kid, National or Columbia will pay a fortune to
the man who can answer that.” Wylie opened the
brief-case and laid a script on the table. It was the
<i>Sue Davis Against the World</i> script.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You want me to read?” Joe asked, incredulous.
His glance swept the restaurant; tables, diners, waitresses.
“Here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie’s hands were brusque, impatient. “I’ve heard
a trouper speak his lines from a hospital bed. If you
live that scene you won’t be Joe Carlin reading to
Vic Wylie in a restaurant. You’ll be Dick Davis talking
to his mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe read. Wylie picked him up on the first sentence;
the sweating agony started. The supper hour
passed and restaurant tables emptied, but at the last
table a man whose hair had become wild goaded
and harried a boy who tried to do miracles with his
voice. The sugar bowl was upset and blocks of sugar,
unnoticed, lay strewn across the cloth. Joe, draining
a water-glass in a momentary respite, thought of
something he had read in high school: “Genius is
the infinite capacity for taking pains.” Sometimes the
producer, frenzied, swooped on the accent of a word,
sometimes the cadence of a phrase. A shade of difference,
a mere shade. Often that was all Vic Wylie
asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>A porter came to the back of the restaurant with
mops and pails. The producer, hearing the clatter of
chairs being lifted from the floor and stacked on
tables, shook his head as though to clear it of a mist,
stared at the spilled sugar, and was all at once quiet,
inert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What time is it, kid?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eleven-thirty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A long day.” Vic Wylie put the script back in
the leather case.</p>

<p class='c010'>Royal Street had the exhausted midnight desertion
of an avenue given over during the day to brisk business
and the shuffle of crowds. A parked taxi waited
hopefully at a corner. Fog was coming in on a damp
east wind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re a worker, kid,” Wylie said. “You’ve got to
work in this game. When you put on a show, the
listeners hear it only once; it’s got to be good that one
time. I don’t spare myself; I don’t spare my casts. I
like an actor who’ll go along with me and take it.”
He stood on Royal Street and rubbed his chin.
“What’s Carver doing for you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He got me station auditions,” Joe said. It came to
him with a shock of surprise that he hadn’t thought
of Amby all day. Or of the McCoy Building.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nobody has to get anybody station auditions.
Anything else?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He got me a bit part in <i>I Want Work</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Funny! I always thought FKIP picked its own
casts. What’s he getting?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fifty per cent until I’m twenty-one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie made a sound with his lips. “Think you
could leave word some place that Carver’d pick up?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe nodded. “I think so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I use an actor who has an agent, I like to
talk to that agent. Tell Carver I’ll be looking for him
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was an oasis of light and life outside the
FKIP Building where a loudspeaker from the hall
brought the blare of a late program to the street.
The Northend bus carried a handful of sleepy passengers.
Joe thought with surprise: “I’m not tired
to-night.” Radio dealt you a life that was so full, so
packed with surprise, so different. Amby Carver, for
instance. He had ideas about Amby, but he wasn’t
quite sure. Archie Munn in a tilted chair, philosophic,
resigned. Did all radio performers haunt producers’
offices and spend anxious hours in anterooms? Lucille
Borden, too hard, too tough for the lead in the
Munson show. Two young singers “at liberty,” probably
almost broke in a strange city, looking for an
engagement and trying to hide their worry behind a
mask of sparkling animation. Show business! Vic
Wylie going into wild, creative trances. Vic Wylie
pleading, Vic Wylie storming, Vic Wylie cutting you
into inch pieces, Vic Wylie insulting you with maddening
sarcasm. You hated him. You loathed him.
You—you’d do anything for him any day in the week,
every week.</p>

<p class='c010'>A light burned upstairs in the Carlin home. “That
you, Joe?” his mother called.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A late rehearsal,” said Joe. “You’d never guess
where. In a restaurant.” All at once he began to
laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>And yet, as he dropped off to sleep, his thoughts
were not with a strange rehearsal in a restaurant, but
with books. Romance and adventure! How could his
father sell romance and adventure on the air?</p>

<p class='c010'>A nervous Ambrose Carver telephoned him in the
morning. “What does Vic want, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He says he likes to talk to an actor’s agent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well—Did he say what time? How about three?
You can go in with me and sort of break the ice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What ice? Isn’t he a great friend of yours?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A pal, Joe, a pal. I haven’t been seeing much of
Vic lately....” There was a moment of silence.
“Make it three o’clock sharp.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe Carlin walked into the office of Vic Wylie Productions
at half-past two. The door to the inner office
was closed. Behind that door a voice was lifted momentarily
in audible protest. Joe swung around to
Miss Robb.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Carver?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c010'>The stenographer said: “Ambrose Carver. Know
him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s my agent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can tell him you’re here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll wait,” said Joe.</p>

<p class='c010'>He took the chair that had been warmed for hours
yesterday by Archie Munn. Amby had distinctly said
three o’clock. Not once, twice. Why had three o’clock
been so strongly stressed the second time? To make
sure that he did not come in until three? But Amby’s
original thought had been for them to go to Wylie
together. Word by word, the telephone conversation
came back to Joe. He had reminded Amby of
a claimed friendship. That, he decided, was when
Amby must have shifted his plans.</p>

<p class='c010'>Why? Joe got up from the chair and walked to
a window near Miss Robb’s desk. What was Amby
anxious to hide? As he debated this question, one
fact became clear. To-day his suspicions concerning
the agent would be verified or dissipated. For, when
the brisk man with the trick mustache came out of
Wylie’s office, what had been between an agent and
an actor would be cemented with a stronger bond or
else it would be destroyed. He didn’t know how or
why. All he knew was that this was so.</p>

<p class='c010'>Behind that closed door Vic Wylie was speaking
words of scorn.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Carver, you’re a chiseling crook. You never went
out to Northend High to hear Carlin in a school
play. You had nothing to do with FKIP calling him
in for an audition. You’ve made a few friends around
the stations; you’ve oiled yourself in on auditions.
When you find them putting some kid down as a
possibility, you get to that kid quickly. The kid’s
green, awed, gullible. You sell him a bill of goods.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re a phony. You’ve hung around studios,
you’ve watched producers at work, you’ve picked
up a smattering of technic. You don’t know radio
and you never will. But if you can gather in twenty
credulous kids, that will set you up, won’t it? Fifty
per cent from twenty kids. They have some talent or
a station wouldn’t have listed them. In time they’ll
get a little work. Perhaps they’ll earn ten or twelve
dollars a week. Half to you. That leaves them six
dollars a week. They’ll manage to live, God knows
how. But Mr. Carver, the agent, collects at least one
hundred dollars a week. Mr. Carver gets himself a
nice racket; Mr. Carver lives soft.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby’s lips were dry. “You’ve got me wrong, Mr.
Wylie. I’ve been working for Joe....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ve been working for nobody but Carver. I
could expose you to the kid, but I’ll let him find you
out gradually. He’s young. He’ll learn about the rat-holes
of show business soon enough. You’re taking
an agent’s ten per cent and no more. You’re not entitled
to that, but the easy way is best. I don’t want
you trying to make trouble on the contract.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The word “contract” gave Amby a sudden boldness.
“A legal contract,” he blustered. “Nobody can
get around that. Joe’s father signed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie leaned across the desk. “You’re mailing Joe’s
father a new contract. A ten per-cent contract. You
can give him any reason you like.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby sprang to his feet. “That contract’s iron-clad.
Why should I take ten? Do I look dumb?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll let you write the answer,” Wylie said. “Radio
wants the good will of the public; it can’t let itself
get hurt. I’ll go to every station in the city and show
them how they’ve opened their doors to somebody
who’ll hurt them in the end. How long do you think
it will be before they bar you? Who do you think
they’ll listen to, a gyp agent or Vic Wylie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It didn’t take Amby long to write the answer. If
the stations tossed him out.... He had come to this
meeting wearing spats and a panama and sporting a
jaunty cane. He ran the cane thoughtfully through
one hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie glowered. “Speak fast.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-morrow,” Amby said reluctantly. He could find
no “out”; he had to take it. He smoothed his hair and
straightened his tie. Wylie opened the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe swung around from the window.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby’s cane made a flourish. “Joe, Vic and I have
had a long talk about you. No time to give it all to
you now.... An agent isn’t all pocket-book, Joe.
Sometimes he sees big things shaping up and he
plays ball. He voluntarily shortens his end. This gives
an actor more incentive. You see, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was expressionless.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mean I’m clipping myself. I’m cutting my end
from fifty to ten.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe stared, steady, unblinking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You won’t need Joe to-day, Vic?” Amby asked, ill-at-ease.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie said: “Not to-day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby’s cane made another flourish. “All right,
Joe; we’ll be getting along.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe Carlin did not move from the window.</p>

<p class='c010'>The agent went alone to the door. The situation
was becoming awkward. “Hot, isn’t it?” he asked in
the lame way a flustered man speaks who feels he
has to say something.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nobody answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby cleared his throat. “I’ll take care of that,
Vic.” He was making conversation. “First thing in
the morning. Nice lay-out you have here. I may
move into this building when my lease runs out....”
He gave it up. “Coming, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not now,” said Joe.</p>

<p class='c010'>The jaunty cane faltered on a flourish. Ambrose
Carver opened the door and stepped out into the hall.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER 5</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Radio lay in its cocoon of summer coma. Most of
the chain serials and most of the local dramatic programs
were off the air until September, and no new
shows, chain or local, stepped into the vacated spots.
The blight hit actors, singers, and musicians. It also hit
auditions: FKIP, FFOM and FWWO would not
hear eager, aspiring talent again until the fall. Heat
baked the city, and a torpid world of radio counted
the weeks until September.</p>

<p class='c010'>For Joe Carlin, life had changed: the dusty McCoy
Building and the stage-effect microphone in Ambrose
Carver’s office became something that had happened
in the past. His days were now spent in Vic Wylie’s
office. If Wylie, in the agony of putting together six
shows for the fall, could give him only half an hour,
that half-hour became something to look back upon.
If the disheveled, wild-haired producer could give
him no time at all, there was always the possibility
of a half-hour to-morrow. And even if he caught only
fleeting glimpses of Wylie for two or three days at a
stretch, every moment of those days he was living
and breathing the atmosphere of real, exciting show
business.</p>

<p class='c010'>Radio people were at liberty, and “at liberty”
meant, bluntly, out of work. Suddenly Vic Wylie’s
office became a gathering place for idle actors and
actresses, a sort of unofficial club. Some passed into
the inner office to audition for parts in the six shows
coming up; others, slanting constant glances toward
the closed door, lounged in the outer office and
chatted with a gay light-heartedness that seemed to
Joe to fill the place with magic. The entrancing gossip
of show business was all about him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I understand FKIP’s auditioned the <i>I Want Work</i>
platter a dozen times and can’t hook a sponsor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t put much faith in novelty shows. They’re
too big a gamble.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What isn’t a gamble in radio?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who ever dreamed the quiz shows would get
four stars?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anybody hear that He, Inc., may put on a show?”
He, Inc., were outfitters for men and boys.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I heard that, too. Yesterday, at FFOM.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was quick interest in the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who’s got it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Probably the Everts-Hall Agency. They’ve always
had the He account.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A woman powdered her nose. “That means Tony
Vaux will be the producer. Good old Tony! He used
me twice last season. I might drop in on Tony and
give him my best smile.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A man said: “No chance, child. This show will go
stag.” “Stag” meant an all-male cast.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe drank it in. He came to know them all—the
fortunate few who passed into the inner office and
the idle group that was very often thoughtlessly in
Miss Robb’s way. They gave Joe a rich sense of
warmth and comradeship. Spontaneously he was Joe
and the others became Barbara, or Jane, or Bill, or
Jim. The free-and-easy familiarity filled him with a
glow. Once, hearing these persons on the air, he had
looked upon them in envy as beings miraculously set
apart, and now he was one of them, accepted. Archie
Munn had pointed out Tony Vaux and he had been
awed; but now, when the red-faced agency producer
breezed toward the inner office with a boisterous
“Howdy, folks?” his voice lifted freely with the
others. “Hi, Tony.” He was in show business. He
belonged.</p>

<p class='c010'>But easy familiarity faltered at two places. Something
about the brooding Vic Wylie.... Everybody
else said “Vic,” but the “Vic” stuck in Joe’s throat.
And there was a gentle old trouper the group hailed
as Pop. The Pop also stuck. To Joe, these men were
Mr. Wylie and Mr. Bartell.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pop Bartell came in every morning, always wearing
the same blue suit with the white pin stripe, always
with his linen immaculate. Often he would
walk into the office so quietly that Miss Robb would
not know he was there until he spoke. From the rear
his slim, straight back gave him an appearance of
youth. But his voice, the way it broke on a word,
stamped him. Pop was old.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good morning, Miss Robb.” His greeting, courtly
and deferential, never varied. “Is there a letter this
morning? A telephone message? I’m expecting a call—there’s
a fat part coming up. No? Thank you. To-morrow,
perhaps,” Miss Robb would agree.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the old man was ever disappointed, he gave no
sign. Bright-eyed, he would give the room a gallant
greeting.</p>

<p class='c010'>The day came when anger mounted in Joe. The
morning loungers had trouped out and taken away
their gay, bright gossip; he and Archie, Lucille and
Stella Joyce remained, as they remained each day,
for the moment when driving, demanding Vic
Wylie might need them. At one o’clock they went
out to eat at a thirty-five-cent restaurant.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pop Bartell was on Joe’s mind. “If somebody’s
promised to write or telephone, why don’t they do
it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pity lay in Lucille Borden’s eyes. “Don’t you understand?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s there to understand? Somebody’s promised
him a part. Why do they keep him hanging on a
hook? It’s cruel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pop doesn’t expect a call,” Lucille said. “Walking
into a producer’s office and asking about a call gives
Pop a chance to keep up a front. He can pretend he’s
not a washed-up has-been.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was shocked. “You mean—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archie Munn tapped a fork against the table. “It’s
tough, Joe, but it’s show business. Pop’s an old timer.
He’s been through it all—medicine shows, street carnivals,
burlesque, road companies. After forty years
of it, one-night stands took it out of him. He turned
to radio; after all, show business is all he knows.
Vic’s been able to throw him a few bits.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was still shocked. “You mean he doesn’t get
much work?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ve heard his voice. How many radio shows
have old-man parts?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Compassion tied a knot in Joe’s throat. To come
to this after forty years must be bitterly hard. But
were they sure about the forty years? It didn’t seem
possible. There wasn’t a gray hair on Pop’s head.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella Joyce seemed to read his thoughts. “You’ve
heard of hair dye, Joe? If Pop were in a bread line,
his shoulders would be back. It’s all front.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Everything’s front in show business,” Archie
Munn said roughly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lucille Borden’s voice was quiet. “A brush can
keep one suit going a long time. An actor with one
shirt washes it every night and hangs it to dry while
he sleeps.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So that was how it was! Joe, his throat still tight,
ate food that was tasteless. They went back to the
office.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vic Wylie, impatient, awaited them. “Stella! You,
kid! We have about an hour.” Hours were measured
in this office in precious minutes. The door to the
inner office closed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Something new, Vic?” Stella Joyce asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The same <i>Davis</i> show.” Wylie mauled among the
papers on his desk. “Tony thinks Munson may be
ripe for an audition. This is one of the scripts we’ll
give him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe tried to rise to the occasion, to feel the old
thrill of rehearsing for Vic Wylie. But to-day the
typed words were meaningless. He thought: “This is
about the fifteenth time we’ve run through this script.
Last time Mr. Wylie rubbed his hands and said he
was satisfied.” He should have known better. Wylie
was never satisfied. And gentle Pop Bartell would
come in to-morrow....</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella was reading. Joe thought in desperation:
“I’ve got to forget Pop.” He’d have to pick up the
story in a moment. Wylie’s outstretched finger wavered,
waited for Stella’s last word, and then swung
toward him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe, as Dick Davis, began to give the identical
passage he had read for the producer his first day
in this office:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Dick</span>: Mother, don’t shake your head at
me like that. You must listen to me. I’m not
trying to duck out of high school. I can get
through at night. I can get college at night.
Oh, I know fellows talk about night study
and never get to it. But—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stop!” Wylie’s flat palms pounded the desk. “I’m
only human. I can stand only so much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella gave attention to a button on her blouse.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ve coached you, kid. I sweated blood over you.
Last week I said to myself: ‘The kid improves with
every performance.’ And what do you do? What do
you give me to-day? To-day you give me a performance
that reeks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The room on the ninth floor was so quiet they
could all hear the purr of automobile traffic from
the street.</p>

<p class='c010'>Abruptly Wylie turned around and pointed a clawing
finger at Stella.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl, giving no sign that she had witnessed a
typical Wylie rehearsal storm, began again at the
beginning. Joe tried to whip himself to pitch. His
moment came:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Dick</span>: Mother, don’t shake your head at me
like that. You must listen—</p>

<p class='c013'>Wylie’s face stopped him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you alive?” the producer whispered hoarsely.
“Let me feel your arm. You are alive? Then why
don’t you pour life into it? You’re not talking to a
broom. This is a scene between two human beings,
mother and son. You’re not Charlie McCarthy; you’re
Dick Davis.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe knew he was wooden. He tried to take the knot
out of his throat, tried and tried.... They ran through
the scene, again and again. Sweat wilted the boy’s
collar and he pulled off his tie. He no longer knew
whether he was good or bad.</p>

<p class='c010'>And then suddenly Wylie was smiling, Wylie was
chuckling, Wylie was beaming. “Kid, that was the
knockout. Now you’re giving it to me. I knew we’d
pull the cork. Carry it on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella Joyce, as unruffled as though she had just
begun to read, carried on the script.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pretty.” The wild Mr. Wylie was actually jovial.
“But—not quite. A little more hokum. Just a little,
Stella.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella gave the script a shade more heart throb.
Wylie closed his eyes and became beatific. Joe waited
for his cue. He began to read:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Dick</span>: We’re in this fight together, Mother.
We’re partners. At least we’re supposed to be.
But we can’t be partners when you carry all
the load and I just ride along. I—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please!” Wylie wailed. “Don’t you get this scene
at all? Your mother’s fighting the world to keep her
little home together and you want to help. Do you
have to read it as though you’re arguing to put one
more pickle in the picnic lunch?” A beaming face
was transformed to fury. “Do you have to insult me
with such a performance?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe laid down the script “I can’t read to-day, Mr.
Wylie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What?” Wylie seemed to freeze with horror.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m not in the humor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie’s moan was that of a man whose soul was in
agony. “He’s not in the humor! An actor, and he must
be in the humor. Do you think an actor is somebody
who can read his lines only when the wind’s in the
east? Suppose Munson were listening and this was
an audition? Suppose this script were on the air?
Suppose—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vic,” said Stella.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie glared. “Would you like to produce this
show?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He heard something to-day that hit him hard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We all hear things that hit us hard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella said: “He got the truth about Pop Bartell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see,” Vic Wylie said slowly. Madness went out
of him. He picked up Joe’s discarded script, folded it
once, and ran a fingernail along the crease. When he
spoke his voice was quiet. “That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was bleak. Show business had a code, a stern,
rigid code. “The show must go on.” Generations of
actors had lived that code, but he had failed. Stella
was walking toward the outer office. Wylie’s voice
halted him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come back, kid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe went back.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vic Wylie’s deep-set eyes brooded. “Kid, you have
imagination. You feel deeply. That’s a blessing and
a curse. You’re the kind’ll run into things in show
business that’ll make you feel sick inside. It isn’t all
music and lights and twinkling toes. That’s the mask.
Every so often the mask slips, and you see behind it,
and that’s when you’ll get sick inside. The old Pop
Bartells make you want to cry. How about the young
Pop Bartells? You had a bit in the <i>I Want Work</i>
platter. That was about the best cast you could
assemble in this city. The best, kid. There isn’t one of
them averages more than twenty-two dollars a week
for the year. Some earn less than that. If they have a
family, then there’s somebody to take care of them
when they get sick. If they’re holed up in some
shabby furnished room, they end up in the charity
ward of a hospital.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought of the gay, light-hearted gathering
in the producer’s outer office. His lips were stiff.
“But they’re so—so—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure. The grandest people in the world. Many of
them are artists, real artists. That’s what makes it
all the tougher.” The hand of this new Vic Wylie was
on Joe’s shoulder. “Don’t let it tear you apart, kid.
You can’t change it. It’s show business.”</p>

<div id='i103'  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/img-103.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Vic Wylie said, “Don’t let it tear you apart, kid. You can’t change it. It’s show business.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But show business had changed for Joe Carlin.
Pop Bartell’s appearance at Miss Robb’s desk to ask
for mail or telephone calls became poignant with
pathos. And the loungers were no longer a happy-go-lucky
group of care-free Bohemians, snapping their
fingers at to-morrow and laughing at to-day. Knowledge
had come to the boy, and with knowledge had
come, also, a stark understanding. The bright chatter
was all at once a little too bright and brittle, and the
gaiety was tarnished. Listening and watching, he
caught the hidden nervous tension, the moments
when smiles faltered, the meaning of those swift
glances to the closed door behind which Vic Wylie
had shows in the making and parts to be given out.
He knew now how unsure were all their to-morrows,
how precarious, how uncertain. All the light-hearted
magic of their easy fellowship was gone and they
were stripped of their masks, of what Archie Munn
called “a front.” They were ordinary human beings,
men and women beset by the everyday worries of
getting a job and never knowing how long the job
would last.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought, with the knot back in his throat, “Oh,
but they’re brave!” That was what hit him hardest—their
unquenchable optimism, their unbreakable
hope. To-morrow they might crash the big time. It
was always to-morrow. Hadn’t it taken Frank Bacon
thirty years to reach Broadway with <i>Lightnin’</i>? Pop
Bartell had been the first to tell him about Frank
Bacon; remembering the day, he could also remember
the wistfulness, the yearning in Pop’s eyes. Brave,
gallant people who, forever living in uncertainty and
doubt, could nevertheless put on a mask each day
and live out each day with a smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>Panic touched Joe Carlin. He didn’t want to live
like that. The gallant heart of show people, yes; but
not the constant uncertainty. He wanted the feeling
of security, if there was such a miracle as security in
radio. He couldn’t go on forever talking of a mythical
to-morrow and never having an actual to-day. He
couldn’t go on loafing in an outer office and having
his father leave money each week on his bedroom
dresser. He couldn’t let somebody else support him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then what was he doing all day, every day, at Vic
Wylie’s? There were a few other independent producers,
there were radio stations, there were advertising
agencies with accounts that bought shows and
radio time. Wasn’t it common sense to make the
rounds? Why didn’t all those gay, idle show people
make the rounds? He asked Archie Munn.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t make a dash for the 5:30 train at 4:30,”
Archie told him. “Radio’s dead until the end of August.
If something breaks suddenly, the producers
know where to find the people they want.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How many producers know me?” Joe asked,
anxious.</p>

<p class='c010'>Archie Munn said: “Vic takes care of his people.
Leave it to Vic.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was lulled, but after that the shadow of uncertainty
was never very far away. A milk company
signed one of the six shows, and the inner office
knew the fever of refining one production. Joe fretted
idly in the outer room, went out to the thirty-five-cent
restaurant with Arch, Lucille, and Stella, and fretted
away the hours of the afternoon. Wylie now had
time for only the one signed show.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella Joyce’s fingers, lately, always had to be
nervously busy with something. “I thought Tony said
he had Munson about ready for a <i>Sue Davis</i> audition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe caught the thin thread of strain in her voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lucille Borden stood up suddenly. “You had a
ten-trip ticket to New York, Archie. Any of it left?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Three rides.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had a letter this morning. N.B.C. wants me in
for an audition to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archie Munn took the ticket from his pocket.
“Lucky gal,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lucille said: “Perhaps.” Joe weighed a tone, an
almost imperceptible breathlessness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next day Lucille Borden was gone. Why, Joe asked
himself, three rides left on a ticket? Why a ten-trip
ticket? Had Archie Munn tried to crash the big time
in New York and flopped? The same crowd, the same
merry voices filled the outer office; the same veiled,
hungry eyes watched Vic Wylie’s door. Noon came,
and then one o’clock. And then it was 1:15.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aren’t we eating to-day?” Joe asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m not particularly hungry,” Stella Joyce said
slowly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Archie Munn’s deep voice was casual. “Suppose
we have a bite in here? Crackers, cheese and a container
of coffee. Fifteen cents apiece ought to do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe made the purchases. Archie took cups from
one of Wylie’s filing cabinets and they spread the
food on the sill of an office window.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mmmm!” Stella said appreciatively. “Good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And she had said she wasn’t hungry! The truth
dawned on Joe. A thirty-five-cent lunch yesterday; a
fifteen-cent lunch to-day; perhaps a ten-cent lunch
next week. And Lucille borrowing a railroad ticket
because she couldn’t afford to pay train fare. Show
business!</p>

<p class='c010'>Panic had him again. Vic Wylie had said: “The
best cast in the city.” What would they do if their
money ran out? Where would he be but for help
from his father? He thought of Pop Bartell.</p>

<p class='c010'>The urge to do something, anything, became imperative.
Anything that wouldn’t let the hours pass
as they were passing. Agencies, radio stations, producers—but
where should he start? What would he
say? And, if this was not the accepted time to look
for parts, what sort of figure would he cut? Unable
to make up his mind, he sat through the afternoon
in the outer office.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next day Lucille was back. How had it gone? She
shrugged. New York put on a lot of dog. Uniformed
attendants, a fortune spent on lavish furnishings,
studios that were the last word in luxury. But the net
result had been the same: “Thank you, Miss Borden.”
New York might have been FKIP.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, all at once, Stella Joyce was gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Summer stock,” said Archie Munn. “The Pasture
Players. Forty miles up in the mountains; a vacation
colony. A theater that was once a barn.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Days of stress followed with Vic Wylie looking
hollow-eyed and wilder. Three more of the Wylie
shows were auditioned, but sponsors were coy. Suppose
the <i>Sue Davis</i> show failed to book Munson? The
thought stayed with Joe. And yet, bringing in a one
o’clock lunch of coffee and sandwiches—a single
sandwich for each—he put on a front.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Ritz,” he announced, “<i>à-la</i>-Wylie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lucille, sipping coffee, said: “Sonny’s coming
back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was staggered. Sonny Baker? Why, Sonny had
had the lead in <i>City Boy</i> last season over at FKIP.
Sonny had gone into summer stock on the coast with
a company near Hollywood. The <i>Journal</i> had had an
item on the radio page....</p>

<p class='c010'>“What about the story that the movies were keeping
an eye on Sonny?” Joe asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If they were,” Lucille said coolly, “they saw all
they wanted to see. Sonny’s been getting urgent letters.
Those letters are bringing him back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe, pouring second cups of coffee, suddenly put
the container down. “Who’s been writing those letters?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archie Munn gave him a glance. “The boy’s fast on
the catch.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Amby Carver?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Nobody answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a cold feeling in Joe’s insides that hot
coffee couldn’t warm. He had met Ambrose Carver
twice since coming over to Vic Wylie, and the agent
had been effusive. But Joe knew now that the little,
dapper man with the trick mustache had not forgiven
him. Six weeks ago Amby had told him in effect
that last season Sonny had been the only adequate
juvenile—the programs had had to use him. “Next
season,” Amby had boasted, “when Sonny auditions
for a part, he’ll find Joe Carlin auditioning for the
same part.” The stage was the same, but Amby had
shifted the scenery. Joe Carlin, auditioning a part,
would find Sonny Baker competing, reading the
same part.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lucille held out her cup. “I always figured Amby
as a sort of tramp.”</p>

<p class='c010'>That, Joe told himself, didn’t change matters.
When a juvenile part came up, it could be played
by only one actor. The agent had, undoubtedly, made
some arrangement with Sonny. Certainly not a fifty-fifty
arrangement. Sonny would be too wise; Sonny
had been around. But whatever the arrangement
might be, Amby had brought more trouble into an
uncertain profession already loaded with plenty of
trouble.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie popped out of the inner office as though he
were on wires. “Kid! Tony Vaux’ll be here at three
o’clock. Come in with him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>What did this mean—the <i>Sue Davis</i> show at last?
Tony Vaux was the Everts-Hall Agency, and the
agency had the Munson account.... The hope in Joe
died—the quick hope that the show might be sold
before Sonny’s return. They couldn’t audition without
Stella Joyce, and to-day Stella was probably playing
a matinée forty miles away.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony Vaux arrived boisterously. “Howdy, folks;
howdy.” Joe went in with him. Wylie had a script
ready.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That one passage, kid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the <i>Sue Davis</i> show. It was the speech over
which Wylie had made him slave and toil. He disciplined
his mind and forced himself to forget Sonny
Baker and Amby. The show must go on! To-day it
seemed that all the coaching the fiery, temperamental
Vic Wylie had pounded into him flowed out
in fulfilment. He felt a sense of mastery as he read
the familiar lines:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Dick</span>: Mother, don’t shake your head at
me like that. You must listen to me. I’m not
trying to duck out of high school. I can get
through at night. I can—</p>

<p class='c013'>To-day he was Dick Davis. He finished the speech
and looked at Wylie.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie, dark circles under his eyes, spoke a single
word to Tony Vaux. “Voice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony spoke another word. “Character.” He reached
for the telephone. “Will you get me my office, Miss
Robb?” The call came through. Tony said to somebody:
“What are my appointments for to-morrow?”
The telephone gave out metallic sounds; the man put
it down. “Think you could find your way over to the
agency at noon to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe knew the question must be for him. He still
looked at Wylie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tony wants you to read a part,” Vic said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another show? Joe Carlin’s world became a world
of exultation. That gave him a chance at two parts.
Later he remembered that neither Wylie nor Tony
Vaux had said anything about his reading, about the
quality he had given the lines. They had spoken only
about his voice. It didn’t seem important at the
moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>With a noon appointment at the Everts-Hall
Agency, there was nothing to take him to Wylie’s
office next morning. And yet the never-failing excitement
of a roomful of actors and actresses, the
vitality of their crisp conversation, was a potent lure.
He arrived early to find Stella Joyce at a window
looking down at the street.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anything wrong?” Joe asked. The girl had expected
to stay in summer stock until Labor Day.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella made one of her quick, bird-like gestures.
“Nothing that hasn’t happened before. Rain; poor
business. If I want to eat beans out of a can there are
lots of beans down here; I don’t have to play in
cowbarn drama.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe didn’t understand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella said: “The ghost had bunions.” She gave a
wry smile that trembled at the corners.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe understood that. In show business the ghost
walks or the ghost doesn’t walk. A walking ghost is a
paying ghost. When the ghost doesn’t walk, there’s
no money.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The cast hasn’t been paid in three weeks,” Stella
added without rancor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was learning—the mask, the off-hand casualness,
the front. “Well,” he said, “that’s show business.”
His mouth held a bitter taste.</p>

<p class='c010'>Noon found him at the agency. The Everts-Hall
people had an entire floor in a downtown building.
The reception-room was a wide, fan-shaped space
of floor facing the elevators. The reception clerk telephoned
inside. “Mr. Carlin to see Mr. Vaux.” A boy
led him to Tony’s room.</p>

<p class='c010'>The room was vast. There were eight windows, an
immense rug, stacks of scripts, shelves of books, some
of which might later be dramatized for radio, and a
great table of magazines. And there was red-faced
Tony Vaux in a vivid pepper-and-salt suit.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Howdy, Joe. Right on the minute; never keep a
curtain waiting.” The inevitable script appeared.
“This is a show for the He crowd. A Curt Lake
script.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe experienced a sense of confidence, as though
he had walked into a room with uncertainty and had
found it peopled with friends. <i>Sue Davis</i> was also a
Curt Lake script.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The He crowd want a show that’ll have a man-and-boy
pull. There it is. <i>Bush League Larry</i>. A
baseball script with two principal characters. Larry
Logan, coming off a farm to pitch for a team in an
alfalfa county league and old Ike Totten, who lives
alone and has one interest in life—baseball. The He
crowd may go on the air early in September with a
three-a-week. Capitalize right at the start on the
growing interest of a coming World Series. In the
script we have Larry catch the eye of a scout and be
signed for a spring try-out. We’ll run Larry and Ike
through the winter on a string of adventure. Larry
loses a finger in a hunting accident. Will he be able
to pitch with three fingers? There’s your suspense.
The script opens with Larry’s arrival at the alfalfa
town. I’ll be Ike.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A man came in with some advertising lay-outs and
talked to Tony. Joe had a chance to scan the script:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Sound—Train Coming on to Mike and
Stopping at Station</span></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Conductor</span> (above escaping steam): Ticeville.
Here’s where you get off, young fellow. All a-a-aboard.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sound—Train Panting Leaves Station. Fades</span></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ike</span>: Looking for somebody, stranger?</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Larry</span>: I’m looking for Bud Wilson.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ike</span>: If you’re a salesman trying to sell Bud
some baseball goods, you’re wasting your
time. Bud’s Ticeville team ain’t been going so
good. When a team in these parts don’t win,
folks stay away.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Larry</span>: I’m to meet Bud Wilson at the ball
park. Is it far?</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ike</span> (eagerly): You a ball player?</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Larry</span>: I hope so.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ike</span> (in rising excitement): A pitcher? Tell
me quick. You got a fast ball?</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Larry</span>: Back home they call it the ‘There
it ain’t’ ball.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ike</span>: Son, if you’ve got a smoke ball and
you don’t need a surveying party to show you
where the plate is—</p>

<p class='c013'>The man with the advertising lay-outs left.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right, Joe.” Tony Vaux chuckled jovially. “Let’s
you and me play some baseball.” He mumbled Ike
Totten’s opening lines, feeding them merely as careless
cues.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe picked up the part. Wylie, hearing him read
the first time, had ripped his first sentence apart with
a fiery tongue. Tony, offering no criticism, kept
mumbling dialogue. The audition went on to the
script’s end, one person doing no more than making
sounds, the other trying to breathe character and
atmosphere and feeling into words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You almost make me feel you’re a green rookie,”
Tony chuckled. “But not a scared rookie. Get the
point, Joe? You’ve never been off the farm. You’re a
big, husky, corn-fed kid; you’re scared and you’re
homesick. You’re not going to let anybody see you’re
scared. You play tough. Not too tough. Some of the
scare peeping through the toughness. Let’s try it
that way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They went through the script again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Better, Joe. You pick up fast. Now, a little more
uncertainty in the toughness. Remember your first
audition? FKIP, wasn’t it? I’ll lay a bet you were a
lost pup. Well, Joe, this time it’s baseball, not radio.
Once more.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They read the script five times. Tony was always
a bland, kindly mentor sugaring his criticism with a
chuckle. There was no hair-tearing, no stricken horror,
no mortal agony. The telephone tinkled. Tony
said: “Ask him to wait,” and mumbled Ike Totten’s
lines for the sixth time. Joe began to vision two systems.
Tony Vaux got results, too. But no Tony Vaux
show, he suspected, would have the passionate perfection
of minor details, the small refinements of a
Vic Wylie show.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s reading,” Tony pronounced mellowly. “You
get it over.” He shook hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought with a quick, tingling lift of the heart:
“This part’s mine.” It would be the beginning. He’d
be on the air. He reached the fan-shaped reception-room;
and there, all in a moment, the tingling uplift
oozed out of him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ambrose Carver stood with his back to the room,
intently studying a painting on the wall.</p>

<p class='c010'>So Amby was the person Tony had asked to wait!
Then the agent knew about the He show and was
going to bat for Sonny Baker. Sonny would come
speeding east. Perhaps Sonny would fly east and be
in town to-morrow. Perhaps Amby would have him
in Tony’s office reading the Larry Logan part to-morrow
afternoon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe had only one thought—to get out of there
before the agent faced about. He didn’t want to look
at a little trick mustache; he didn’t want to listen
to what the brisk Amby might have to say. He pressed
a down button and a door slid open. As he stepped
into the car a startled voice called his name. The door
closed and the elevator plunged toward the main
floor.</p>

<p class='c010'>A clock in the lobby gave the time as one-thirty.
Archie Munn would have gone out for coffee and
sandwiches; a Ritz <i>à-la</i>-Wylie lunch would be over.
He debated about food without interest and ended
by going to the thirty-five-cent restaurant. He ordered,
but he scarcely touched what the waitress
brought. He was afraid. Sonny could bring to a part
two or three years of experience. Summer stock and
radio experience. And all he had behind him was
two auditions and a bit part in an FKIP platter.</p>

<p class='c010'>At three o’clock he returned to Vic Wylie’s office.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe!” Miss Robb cried. “Where have you been?
I’ve telephoned every place. They’re auditioning the
<i>Sue Davis</i> show.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was instantly breathless. “Where?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“FKIP. Studio D. Mr. Wylie’s frantic.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What time?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Four o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe bolted.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had plenty of time—a whole hour. And yet he
went along narrow, crowded Royal Street as though
a gale were at his back. Sonny might audition for
Tony Vaux to-morrow, but to-day the field was clear.
Loudspeakers blared in the FKIP building. He rode
to the fourth-floor reception-room of blue leather.
Stella Joyce and three others of the <i>Sue Davis</i> cast
were grouped at the window-seats. With them were
Archie Munn and Lucille Borden.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s Joe,” Stella called, as though she had
been watching the elevators.</p>

<p class='c010'>Archie Munn hastened toward the glass-walled
studios to the right.</p>

<p class='c010'>A loudspeaker in the reception-room hammered
out FKIP’S program, baseball play by play.</p>

<p class='c010'>Archie Munn was back. “That’s one worry off
Vic’s mind. You had him four miles in the air, Joe.
He was flying kites.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The elevator brought up Tony Vaux and a party
of men and women. Tony led them toward the
studios.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe could feel himself tightening. The clamor of
the loudspeaker got on his nerves. Who cared about
baseball to-day? How would the audition go?
Couldn’t they shut that speaker off?</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie, rumpled and wild, burst into the reception-room,
stopped abruptly, stared with unseeing eyes at
his cast, swung about and went back toward the
studios. Almost instantly he was again in the reception-room,
this time lugging the brief-case. An elevator carried
him down; five minutes later another elevator
brought him back. He was talking to himself as he
made for the studios.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s right knee began to tremble. He shifted his
weight to the other leg, but the tremor grew worse.
His hands were clammy. Was he going to get mike
fright? He had to keep up a front. Maybe he ought
to talk. Talking might help. He said: “Does it always
affect Mr. Wylie that way?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sponsor audition?” Archie Munn’s voice was bitter.
“You don’t know the strain, Joe. The uncertainty.
Munson won’t come in with a few of his store executives
and the Everts-Hall people. He’ll bring in his
uncles, and his cousins, and his aunts. He’s likely to
drag in a couple of his office stenographers and a
taxi driver. What do they know about whether a
show’s good or bad? Somebody says: ‘I just don’t
like it,’ and Munson gets cold feet. Isn’t this show
for the public, and isn’t this somebody who doesn’t
like it one of the public? Perhaps the show really
isn’t good. You can’t blame a sponsor for being careful.
A coast-to-coast hookup may cost $250,000. Even
a single-station, local show is expensive. The sponsor
has to pay for script, production, cast, radio time,
perhaps music. It runs into money. But if a sponsor
wants advice, why doesn’t he rely upon people who
know? You see what Vic’s up against? He spends
weeks and weeks whipping a show into shape, and
then any little nit-wit can throw in a monkey wrench.
Or the sponsor may throw the wrench.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was sorry Archie had told him. His left knee
began to tremble.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Radio has a name for it,” Stella said. “Sponsor
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jovial Tony Vaux appeared suddenly. “All right,
folks; we’re ready for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The cast filed into the glass-walled corridor between
the glass-walled studios. Blue lettering outside
Studio D announced the rehearsal. The tremble in
Joe’s nerves became a hard, uncontrollable jerking.
The microphone was an unreal upright looming
through an unreal light across miles of unreal studio
floor. The control-room was crowded. He saw Munson,
Wylie, Tony Vaux, Curt Lake, the script-writer,
a woman.... The studio itself sheltered another audience.
Perhaps the uncles and aunts, the cousins,
the stenographers, and the taxi driver. They sat in
a long row along one wall. They looked, to Joe, like
a row of stuffed, sardonic owls—blank, expressionless,
motionless, lifeless, staring. Couldn’t one of them so
much as cough?</p>

<p class='c010'>Somebody passed out script. Stella’s hand was on
his arm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nervous?” the girl whispered.</p>

<p class='c010'>The front failed. Joe was pinched and wan.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Stella’s hand was warm, human. “Forget them,
Joe. When you’re on the air you’re talking to thousands.
They’re only a handful of stooges.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She heartened him; he hoped she’d keep her hand
on his arm. Wylie was speaking from the control-room
over the two-way mike. They’d give the first
three scripts; then they’d give the tenth script to show
the program after it had run for a while.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cast was clustered at the mike. They watched
the control-room. Wylie’s hand was in the air. It descended
in an arc, and a finger pointed at Stella.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl began to read. The finger hovered and
pointed at Joe. The finger went back to Stella again.
So Vic Wylie timed and paced his shows.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella’s hand was gone, but her encouraging smile
flashed to Joe with every cue. His tongue loosened,
and the cords of his throat were free. All at once he
was rid of the ghosts of sponsor trouble and the chill
of the silent listeners in the chairs. They no longer
existed. Nothing existed but the script.</p>

<p class='c010'>And then there was no longer a script. The script
was life—the life of Dick Davis and his mother. This,
then, was what Wylie’s plea to “live it” meant. The
cast fused, blended, and became like a mighty, moving
chord from an organ. Time ceased to be studio
time; time was time in the life of the Davis family.
They were playing the tenth script. Joe poured words
that should have been old by now, but which to-day
were new, into the microphone:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Dick</span>: Mother, don’t shake your head at me
like that. You must listen—</p>

<p class='c013'>Stella Joyce spoke the curtain line of the script.
There was a brooding hush, as though the world was
held in a spell.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie’s voice, hoarse with feeling, broke the stillness.
“Thank you. That’s from my heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The studio echoed with the confusion of an audience
breaking up. Chairs scraped, people gathered
in groups, voices made a blurred buzz of sound.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella said: “The woman with Munson is his wife.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie appeared to be in violent argument with
somebody in the control-room. But then, Joe thought,
Wylie was always having a violent moment about
something.</p>

<p class='c010'>He left with Stella. When would they know? Mingling
with the listeners, they passed along the glass-walled
corridor. Men and women stared at them
curiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ball game was still on. They got a part of the
ninth inning in the elevator. Out in Royal Street they
heard the last play of the game.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?” Joe demanded.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella’s head made a quick, bird-like movement.
“We gave them a show.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They waited. Vic Wylie might come out in a few
minutes and tell them something. But when the
producer appeared, he was with Munson, Mrs. Munson,
and Tony Vaux. All four entered a taxi. Wylie
appeared to be still engrossed in argument.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There it goes,” said Stella. “Yes or no. We have a
job or we haven’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archie Munn and Lucille Borden came out of the
FKIP building. Archie, seeing them, made a writing
motion in the air with his right hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Munson’s signing the show,” Stella cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I caught Vic for a moment,” Archie reported. “He
said the audition was a honey. Munson fell hard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re sure?” Joe demanded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They’ve gone over to the Everts-Hall Agency to
put through the contract.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, Joe decided, it was true. Hadn’t he watched
the taxi leave?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look!” he said, happily reckless. “I have four
dollars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Infant,” Lucille drawled, “you don’t know how
much wealth four dollars is until you need four dollars.
Hold on to it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m buying the dinners. We celebrate. Do you
know where we can get a good seventy-five-cent
dinner, Arch?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Carlin,” Archie’s deep voice pronounced
gravely, “I know them all, from swanky hotel dining-rooms down to the joints where you eat for a dime.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Oh, but they were gay. Gay as only show people
can be gay when luck is running. Archie brought
them to a table for four in an Italian basement restaurant.
The food was good. But the talk, Joe
thought, was better. Archie, Stella, and Lucille were
all at their best. There was a bright play of drollery
and a great deal of laughter. This, too, was show
business.</p>

<p class='c010'>A happy Joe Carlin, still chuckling over some of
Archie’s quips, rode out to Northend. To-morrow
Ambrose Carver might steer Sonny Baker into the
He show, but the Munson show was his. Once, the
time FKIP had cut the <i>I Want Work</i> platter, he had
hurried home with a false alarm. What he would
have to tell his folks to-night would be real.</p>

<p class='c010'>Inside the house the telephone rang as he reached
the porch. He heard his mother’s voice:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m sorry; he’s not here now. If you’ll leave your
num—Just a moment. I think I hear him on the
porch. Joe!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who is it?” Joe called.</p>

<p class='c010'>His mother met him in the hall. “That Carver
person.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought: “What can he want?” He went to the
telephone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby’s voice was briskly, softly effusive. “Still
stringing along with Wylie, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why shouldn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t know. After to-day’s sponsor trouble—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What trouble? Mr. Wylie sold the Munson show.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know that, but—didn’t you hear about Mrs.
Munson? You haven’t heard?” The agent made a
clucking sound. “I’m sorry I have to be the one to
break the bad news, Joe; Wylie should have told you.
You’re sure you didn’t hear anything about Mrs.
Munson’s nephew? The actor?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s hand gripped the telephone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A favorite nephew. You know how some women
go daffy over a favorite nephew? This kid plays with
an amateur group at Baltimore. Mrs. Munson thinks
he’s tops.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe had a sudden, vivid recollection of Wylie arguing
violently with somebody in the control-room.
The knuckles of the hand that gripped the telephone
were white. “If you’re trying to tell me something,
Amby—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The agent’s voice grew softer. “I’m telling you it’s
time you dropped Wylie and came back to popper.
Mrs. Munson declared herself. Sponsors do that
sometimes. You’re out of the cast and the favorite
nephew’s in.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER 6</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In the broadcasting studios, along Royal Street,
or in the office of Vic Wylie Productions, Joe Carlin
would have tried to greet disaster lightly and to put
up a front. But the Carlin home was sanctuary. Here,
with the shades drawn and all the rest of the world
shut out, he did not have to pretend. He did not
have to carry a fixed smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>To-night he could not have pretended. Was it to-night
he had bought dinner for Stella Joyce, Lucille
Borden and Archie Munn to celebrate both the selling
of a show and his first radio part? Was it only an
hour ago the four of them had been boisterously
light-hearted around a table in the Italian restaurant?
That hour seemed ages ago, an hour out of a long-ago
past.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stella said we gave them a show,” Joe said, low-voiced,
almost as though he were talking to himself.
“Mr. Wylie thanked us from the control-room—he
meant it. He told Arch the audition was a honey. I
thought everything was set.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin, his pipe filled, neglected to light it.
“How were you, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nobody said I was bad. Maybe I was. Maybe the
cast was good and carried me along.” Joe’s morale
was low.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would Wylie have given you the part if you were
bad?” the man asked sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought of the torture of a Vic Wylie rehearsal.
“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you weren’t bad. You’re sure Munson liked
the show?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Wylie said he fell hard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In other words, if Mrs. Munson didn’t have a
nephew—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe said with an effort: “She must think he’ll play
the Dick Davis part better. Sponsors don’t buy shows
and scramble them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Kate Carlin’s voice was quiet. “You have only
Carver’s word for this, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin’s jaws clamped on a cold pipe-stem.
“Joe, won’t you go through some of this same worry
and anxiety every time you audition for a part?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know,” the man said slowly. “It’s show business.”
He laid down the pipe. “Haven’t you had
enough of show business?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe tried to find words to explain the unexplainable.
Why, after all he had seen of the tinsel and
make-believe, the gay, masquerade lightness, wasn’t
he fed up? But show business was still a land of
glamour. He said uncertainly: “If I do get this part—”
That didn’t explain anything, either. He glanced
helplessly at his mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anything good on the air to-night?” Kate Carlin
asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin took the hint.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next morning FKIP’s ten o’clock music program
blared at Joe as he walked through Royal Street.
What would to-day bring? He dreaded entering Vic
Wylie’s office; he dreaded staying away. He took a
deep breath in the hall and steeled himself for whatever
Wylie would tell him. Smiling, his hat cocked
a little to one side, he opened the door. The bright
babble of light, gay voices met him; Lucille, Stella,
and Archie were in their accustomed corner. He
walked toward the corner, and all at once it was as
though he saw his three friends individually and
apart, each one watchful, wary and withdrawn.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s nerves were tight. He thought: “It’s true;
they know.” He hung up his hat and drawled:
“Amby phoned me last night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was an instant of profound silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought he would.” Lucille’s voice had become
hard. “Little Sunshine Carver.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was casual. “How did Mrs. Munson’s nephew
get into this?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Amby has an idea he’d like to work himself into
the Munson store. Public relations, radio—a nice job.
He heard that Mrs. Munson had a nephew in Baltimore
who was ambitious to get into show business.
Anybody want to guess the rest?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So the nephew,” Stella fluted, “was brought up
here to read to Amby.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That must have been good,” Archie Munn commented
dryly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anybody want to guess,” Lucille asked, “what
Amby told Mrs. Munson? Well, Mrs. Munson fell
for it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s front was perfect. “This Lucille gal should
work for a newspaper. She gets all the news.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Amby talks,” said Lucille.</p>

<p class='c010'>Archie’s deep voice said: “I’d figure myself in
until Vic told me I was out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has Munson bought the show?” Joe demanded.</p>

<p class='c010'>Archie Munn shook his head. “Not yet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All at once the outer office was brighter, and the
charming, crisp talk all around Joe seemed gayer. If
the show had hit a snag, he was the snag. Wylie
wanted him in the part. Violent Vic Wylie was fighting
for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>A voice called: “Hello there, Pop.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pop Bartell was among the gay group, the pin-stripe
suit without a wrinkle, his linen spotless. Miss
Robb, watching for him, stood up at her desk.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have a call for you from Mr. Vaux, Mr.
Bartell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The old trouper stopped short. “Tony Vaux? Of
course. I’ve been expecting—” He had to clear his
throat. “You’re sure it was from Tony, Miss Robb?”
The quavering voice was stark with a pleading appeal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He wants you in at four o’clock to read a part.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At four?” Gentle Pop Bartell began to fumble.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe could not bear to look on. Lucille Borden,
the tough girl of last season’s <i>Years of Danger</i> show,
bit her lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think I can make it.” Pop Bartell was in control
of himself; he had his front. “I’m sure I can be there
at four. Quite sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Not until the old man had departed, gallant and
gentle, did Joe turn back to the room. All the frothy
gossip of the loungers had stopped.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pop,” Archie Munn murmured, “that was an
exit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought: “Tony wants him to read the Ike
Totten part in the He show.” How long since Pop
had had a part? The boy experienced an exhilarating
excitement, as though this were happening to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hands of the clock ran out the morning; the
inner office door remained closed as though Vic
Wylie had shut himself away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who’s in with him?” Joe asked from a chair tilted
against the wall.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nobody,” Miss Robb answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe stood up quickly. “If I could see him for just
a moment—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archie Munn said: “I wouldn’t, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All at once Joe found it hard to swallow. He said:
“So Mr. Wylie won’t talk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lucille drawled: “That’ll be the day.” It was all
carelessly off-hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Joe knew the cold, frightening truth. He wasn’t
out of the <i>Sue Davis Against the World</i> show, but
neither was the part his. It might never be his. Lost
in worry he strode across the room, strode back.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe’s rehearsing for a walk-on,” Stella said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Without warning, the strain of carrying a front
broke him. “It’s the not knowing,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s what always puts the knife into you,”
Archie Munn said bitterly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Infant,” said Lucille, “we’ve all been there. Not
one of us has a sure part for next season.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was startled. “But when <i>Years of Danger</i> went
off last June—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They announced the program would be resumed
in the fall. Well, the sponsor’s changed his mind.
Mamma must find herself another meal ticket.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella’s bird-like voice fluttered: “Casting starts
next week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All their fronts had momentarily cracked. In that
moment Joe Carlin felt very close to them. He took
up the collection for lunch.</p>

<p class='c010'>“See if you can get me a fat part on rye,” Lucille
drawled. They were gay and casual again. Show
business!</p>

<p class='c010'>Coming back with the food, Joe was all at once
conscious that the outer room had undergone another
change. Once more his friends seemed to stand alone,
individual and apart. Once more they had become
watchful and wary.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A gorgeous day,” Archie Munn said. “I’m going
to take a stroll. Who’s with me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lucille held out her cup. “I can be ready in about
five minutes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella was breathless. “Let’s all go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe looked thoughtfully from the two girls to
Archie Munn. Archie, ignoring the scrutiny, took his
hat from a rack.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Care to come along, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe, groping, found the answer. They were trying
to get him out of here and get him out in a hurry.
Why? Lucille, in front of the mirror above the watercooler,
patted a stray curl into place. The rapid-fire
click of a typewriter ceased and Miss Robb carried
letters in to Vic Wylie. A voice came from the inner
room:</p>

<p class='c014'>Were in this fight together, Mother. We’re
partners. At least—</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Robb came back and the door closed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Archie looked at Stella, shrugged, took off his hat,
and placed it back on the rack.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe made a point of carefully, deliberately pouring
more coffee. The Dick Davis part in the Munson
show! His part. “Who’s reading, Arch? Sonny
Baker?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mrs. Munson’s nephew.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They had tried to save him the agony of waiting
for the audition to end. He thought of Vic Wylie.
Wylie, hiding behind a closed door all morning and
keeping him locked out. Wylie, calling somebody
in for an audition and telling him nothing. Wylie,
whom he had believed in, worshiped.... He
dumped what was left of the coffee into the cooler
drain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Archie Munn’s voice was deep in the silence. “Mrs.
Munson says her nephew’s made for the part. She’s
repeating Amby, of course. What can Vic say? That
he isn’t? Vic’s never heard him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was cold. “I thought Mr. Wylie was insisting
on his original cast.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’d still have to call the nephew in. Amby’s
recommendation doesn’t mean a thing, but.... Suppose
the nephew <i>is</i> made for the part?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Words ran through Joe’s mind in numb reiteration.
“That’s what puts the knife into you.” Lucille, Stella,
and Arch were all seasoned performers, and yet, at
this moment, were any of them better off than he?
Didn’t they all know the feeling of the knife? Hadn’t
Arch said so? Ten years from now he might still be
doing what Lucille, Stella, and Arch were now doing—waiting,
hoping for a part. Years made no difference—look
at Pop Bartell. Show business was show
business. Show business put the knife into you, again
and again.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were no sudden, muffled Wylie outbursts
from behind the closed door. Was Mrs. Munson’s
nephew so good that an emotional, hair-trigger producer
could close his eyes, relax, and listen to a perfect
reading? Unable longer to sit still and keep a
death-watch on a closed door, he sprang to his feet,
walked to a window, and stood there looking down
at the crowds flowing through the street nine stories
below.</p>

<p class='c010'>The street seemed full of ants. Puny, scurrying,
human ants bustling in a ceaseless tide. Ants
who didn’t suffer through Vic Wylie rehearsals, who
didn’t know the strain of a sponsor audition, who
didn’t see themselves dropped after they’d slaved
to help sell the show.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella and Lucille went out; he did not hear them
go. Archie Munn stood beside him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was offered a job yesterday,” the actor said
abruptly. “Salary and commission. I used to be a
salesman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Any money in it?” Joe still stared down at the street.</p>

<p class='c010'>“About sixty dollars a week. I turned it down.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s eyes held bitter wisdom. When it got into
you, when you ached to make people laugh and make
them cry, nothing else mattered. But ants would be
satisfied with sixty dollars. Ants would never know
the feeling of a knife as they waited in a producer’s
ante-room.</p>

<p class='c010'>He envied ants.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rattle of a knob, voices, swung him around
from the window. The inner office door was open.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I could have had a few days to study the part,
Mr. Wylie, I could have given you a much better
reading.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t look for a finished performance on first
reading.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you look for, Mr. Wylie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t say. But I always know when I get it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It—it seems to be a good show.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t have anything to do with bad shows.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you’d care to have me read something else....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That won’t be necessary.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well—thank you, Mr. Wylie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re quite welcome.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Munson’s nephew sauntered through the outer
office. About twenty, Joe thought, and wondered if
he’d copied the rakish panama and the cane from
Ambrose Carver. Wylie stood in the doorway, dark
and brooding.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll see you now, kid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe knew how a man on trial must feel when he
rises to hear the verdict of the jury. <i>Sue Davis Against
the World</i> scripts were scattered across Wylie’s desk.
How many had the producer given Mrs. Munson’s
nephew to read? The knife that turned in him now
was a cold knife, blue with chill and frosted with
apprehension.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vic Wylie, behind the desk, enacted a one-man
tragedy. He talked to himself in scorn; he began to
laugh—short, savage outbursts of derision. He put
a coy finger under his chin, smirked, and said something
in a falsetto simper. Abruptly he began to growl
indistinguishable words. He picked up the <i>Sue Davis</i>
scripts, held them a moment and hurled them at the
desk.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe picked them up from the floor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie stared at him, shook his head so that the
reddish hair tumbled left and right, and ran a hand
across his forehead. When he took the hand down
his eyes had grown calm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kid,” he said, “Carver has a knife out for you a
yard long.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All at once suspicion whetted the knife. Joe
thought in dismay: “No; it can’t be.” But suspicion
grew. Amby Carver, trying to force Mrs. Munson’s
nephew into the cast, was understandable; through
the doting aunt, Amby hoped to ease himself into a
fat Munson job. But why should Amby have a knife
out for him? Wasn’t he one of Amby’s assets? Vic
Wylie, posturing and simpering, began to look like
an actor playing a scene well rehearsed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Wylie,” Joe said with an effort, “there’s something
here I don’t get.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re afraid you do get it, kid. I don’t fool easy.
You’re afraid I’m using Carver as a stage prop to
give you the hook.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s face reddened. “He’s my agent, isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suppose you play in the show. Carver’s commission
would be two-fifty a week. Big money.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Suppose you play! Wylie had said that. Joe gave
up faith and all hope. “Why should Amby throw
two-fifty away?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“An agent on the level throws nothing away. He’s
out to get all he can for his client. But an agent on
the level doesn’t try to call Sonny Baker back from
the coast to blast his client.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe had forgotten Sonny. As suddenly as suspicion
had been born, suspicion died. And he’d practically
accused Wylie. His throat grew tight. Oh, he’d
forgotten so much! Amby Carver claiming to be a
pal of all the great and the near-great of radio; shyster
Amby Carver putting him through the burlesque
of meaningless auditions. His mother’s voice, usually
soft and low, saying with acid contempt: “That Carver
person.” Lucille Borden bluntly calling Amby a
tramp.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vic,” Joe said humbly, “try to forgive me.” It was
the first time he had called the producer by his given
name.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kid,” said Vic Wylie, “there’s nothing to forgive.
You were backed into a corner and you threw a
punch. You threw it wild. You don’t know show business
and you don’t know the Carvers. Show business
is lousy with agents. The good ones are worth all you
pay them; the chiselers are rats. You found Carver
out and you gave him the ice. You gave him the ice
before an audience the day you let him walk out
of here alone. He’s vain and he’s cheap. You wounded
his vanity, and that’s the worst thing you can do to a
heel like Carver. He’ll never forgive you. He’ll toss
a commission over his shoulder any day for a chance
to cut your throat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The telephone rang.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hello. Who? Oh, hello, Tony.” Vic Wylie squared
around to the desk and chuckled with acid humor.
“So Mrs. Munson’s been calling you. Isn’t that nice?
Yes, he’s been here; here and gone. Of course I
heard him read. In fact, Tony, I let him read until he
ran down. How was he? A nice little boy who used
to be brought into the parlor to speak pieces for the
company. He wanted to know if he didn’t remind me
of Clark Gable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Sounds came out of the telephone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie’s voice snapped. “Do you know me, Tony,
or don’t you? He can’t act. He hams every line.
I wouldn’t take him if diamonds went with him. If
he had a voice, I might make that voice give something.
He’s a blank. He has nothing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The telephone sputtered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know your agency’s in a spot, Tony. I know
Munson’s one of your best accounts. Blame Carver.
He sold Mrs. Munson the idea her nephew’s a knockout.
What’ll you tell her? Pass the buck to me. Tell
her I said to ship him back to Baltimore.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The producer put down the telephone and was
somber and silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s heart pounded. “Vic.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Vic Wylie brooded. “Don’t get any wrong ideas,
kid. Don’t think I’m handing you something because
I like you. I wouldn’t be in show business long if I
ran a Vic Wylie Friendship Club. I don’t like Carver
any more than I like a polecat, but if this ham he
sent me had dynamite on the ball, you’d be out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s hands, hidden in his pockets, gripped the
lining.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ve cast this show, kid. For my money, it stays
cast. You’re playing the Dick Davis part.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lucille and Archie Munn took the breaks in their
stride—good breaks or bad breaks. Joe tried hard to
be nonchalant. “I wasn’t sure, Vic.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie still brooded. “Don’t try to front me, kid;
I’ve seen too much of it. When you deal with me,
deal clean.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe said, honest and humble: “I was scared stiff.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He was no longer scared, and the knife was gone.
Archie, Miss Robb told him in the outer office, had
left. He called the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s all right, Mother,” he said out of an overflowing
heart. “Everything’s all right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Standing at the window, brushing his hat with his
sleeve, he looked down again at the street. There
they were—ants. Everlastingly sweating and toiling
through the same crowded runways, doing the same
dull tasks to-day, to-morrow, next month, and next
year. No two of his days would ever be alike; no day
would ever be dull. He’d go on the air; his voice
would go out to unseen thousands; he’d make them
laugh and he’d make them cry. He’d know knives
again; it was show business. But for every knife
there’d be a supreme moment of glory like this.</p>

<p class='c010'>He pitied ants.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER 7</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Labor Day saw the end of radio’s coma. Overnight
Stations FKIP, FFOM, and FWWO stirred with new
life; overnight the unofficial players’ club that had
lounged away the summer in Vic Wylie’s outer office
disbanded. Where there had been a great deal of
brightness and gaiety, there was now only the strictly
business-like ring of the telephone and the steady
clatter of Miss Robb’s typewriter.</p>

<p class='c010'>And so Joe Carlin started on the rounds at last.
There was an unaccustomed buoyancy to his stride,
a lilting sway to his shoulders. Amby Carver had
unconsciously given him that. If Vic would kill a
Wylie Productions show rather than release him as
a co-lead, he must be good. Very good. Better than
he had thought. Better than Wylie had ever admitted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hot with anticipation and expectation, he swung
into the tide of show people making the rounds.
Flowing from studio to studio through the crowds
of Royal Street, the tide was somehow brightly set
apart. It eddied into the broadcasting company buildings
vivid with a color all its own; talkative and animated,
it swirled up in the elevators. Talk was all
around Joe, endless and continuous—the feverish
talk of show business. FWWO was auditioning for a
commentator to do a night broadcast of local news.
FFOM wasn’t due to think about casting until to-morrow.
One of the night clubs was canvassing the
talent bureaus of the radio stations for a blues singer.
A girl announced breathlessly that she had worked
up a show for the little tots—FFOM wanted to hear
it. A man said: “A good kid show keeps you in the
chips. Uncle Don’s been running a long time on
WOR.” A tide of show business patter carried Joe to
the office of John Dennis, FKIP’s casting director.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dennis’ small office, crowded, sounded like a
happy-go-lucky, madcap picnic. Joe, stranded in the
hall’s overflow, was much wiser than he had been
last June. This was the bread-and-butter hunt, restlessly
anxious beneath the brightly vivacious surface
of the tide. What did you do when you got in to
Dennis, ask point-blank if he had a part for you? He
should have asked Archie Munn. He hadn’t seen
Stella or Lucille. Apparently when show business
hunted radio’s bread and butter, it hunted alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Listening, Joe discovered that nobody was asking
about parts. The pattern became plain. You made
light-talk and kept up a front. You showed yourself,
day after day, so that casting directors wouldn’t forget
you. A gale of laughter swept out of the room.
A woman came into the hall and John Dennis’ voice
followed her: “To-morrow at four, Babe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe had it. You walked in and cracked a gag. You
might not have a dime in your pocket but you made
sure the gag was good. If they wanted you, they
gave you the nod.</p>

<p class='c010'>A voice behind him said: “Dennis thought the
<i>I Want Work</i> show was a sure five-a-week. Yesterday
they were glad to sell it for Tuesdays and Fridays.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Another voice said: “Bit parts. A lot of us will get
a piece of that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe Carlin’s feet itched to go into a Fancy Dan
Carlin step. He was in at last. He’d have a bit in the
first show. Hadn’t he been one of the cast that had
cut the platter for Dennis? If you were good, you
could make even a bit part stand out.</p>

<p class='c010'>By ones and by twos actors and actresses left John
Dennis’ bread-and-butter shrine and made room
for one or two waiting in the hall. Joe noticed how
the unworried, smiling mask went on at once, how
they stepped across the threshold with an entrance
line to catch the casting director’s attention. The lines
must have been good, for laughter was hearty and
continuous.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe got in at last. He couldn’t think up a gag—not
a good gag.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hello, Joe.” Fat John Dennis was cordial. “Have
a good summer?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Swell,” said Joe. He waited to be told to report
for the <i>I Want Work</i> show. Somebody else came in
with a bright entrance, and there was more laughter.
The circle of interest that had formed around Joe
shifted to the newcomer. The bantering talk was
full of allusions to happenings in radio last season.
That had been before his time; he didn’t understand
the allusions. He felt isolated, one of the crowd but
not a part of it. An actress included him in a sally
and he laughed with the others without knowing
what it was that caused the laughter. He decided to
get out before he began to look like a clown.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Guess I’ll be pushing along.” He took his time
getting to the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Glad to have seen you again,” said John Dennis.
Not a word about the show.</p>

<p class='c010'>An FKIP loudspeaker, scratchy and metallic, tin-panned
the harmony of a quartet as Joe went toward
the elevators; his shoulders swayed. The first moment
of disappointment had passed. The voice in
the hall, he told himself, had been one of those
things; the <i>I Want Work</i> platter was still a turkey.
Long before this every producer, every casting director,
every station must have heard the story of
how Vic Wylie had ridden along with him. If the
<i>I Want Work</i> show had sold, he’d have had a part.
He couldn’t miss. He carried Wylie’s stamp of approval
and Wylie was tops as a picker. If he was
good enough for Wylie, he was good enough for any
of them. He watched a dial that announced the
descent of the elevator. The elevator stopped, and
Amby Carver stepped out.</p>

<p class='c010'>At sight of Joe Carlin the agent’s eyes blinked.
Then the cane made a flourish. “Joe, you’re just the
man I’m looking for. I’m getting a couple of parts
lined up—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Doesn’t Mrs. Munson’s nephew want them?” Joe
asked. He pushed back his hat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe,” little Amby said earnestly, “you got me
wrong. All wrong. Look! Sure I was after a job with
Munson. Why not? Do you know when I tried to
bring the nephew in? After I read the script. If you
want to click with an afternoon show it’s got to have
yum-yum. Is there any love in this Sue Davis show?
Amby Carver’s asking you. I told Munson the script
was stinko. Does your agent want you in a stinko
show that ruins your reputation? So I try to get the
nephew in. I tell Munson the show is such a stinko
only a good actor like his nephew can save it. That
leaves me in the middle. If the show flops, hadn’t I
warned him? Even his nephew couldn’t save it. If it
gets orchids, his nephew did save it. Either way,
Amby Carver’s in right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why didn’t you tell me this at the start?” Joe
asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look! You expect me to call you at Wylie’s? That’s
out. I’m off Vic.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have a telephone at home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The last time,” Amby said with heat, “somebody
calls that it’s that Carver person. Am I supposed to
like that? I’m your agent. I’ve been hustling for you.
I—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You tried to get Sonny Baker back from the
coast,” Joe drawled.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby pulled out a handkerchief and mopped his
face. “I want to tell you about that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe said: “Don’t bother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby’s eyes studied the boy obliquely. The handkerchief
touched the microscopic mustache delicately,
and his voice was soft. “I wouldn’t swallow
everything I’m told, Joe; Vic’s picked lemons before.
Some day when you find Sonny Baker in your hair,
don’t come weeping and wailing to me. You’ve asked
for it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The next elevator carried down a well-pleased-with-himself
Joe Carlin. Amby Carver now knew he
couldn’t be pushed around. Let the agent bring
Sonny Baker back—Sonny was no longer anything
to worry about. When you were good enough for
sneering, insulting Wylie, you were good enough for
any of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The tide of show people through Royal Street had
thinned. Old Pop Bartell swung past, very straight
and very gallant. With FFOM not concerning itself
with the casting problem until to-morrow, the entrance
to the FFOM Building was almost deserted.
Joe went on to FWWO. He had, he reflected, been
inside this station only once, the day Amby had
arranged for him to audition. It had been his worst
audition.</p>

<p class='c010'>FWWO, one of the smaller stations of the city,
didn’t have the crowd that had besieged FKIP. Joe
found three show people in the office of Gillis, the
casting director. They drifted out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hello,” said Gillis. “Glad to see you again. Your
name is—let me see now—Lawton?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Carlin,” said Joe. “Joe Carlin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Carlin. Of course. What was your last show with
us, Carlin?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe explained that he had auditioned last June.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s right; that’s right. I remember now.” But
the director’s vagueness made it plain he didn’t remember
at all. “Have a pleasant summer?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe made his exit. Stella Joyce was coming through
the hall.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Any calls, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing,” he said wryly, and nodded back toward
the office. “They didn’t remember me.” That wouldn’t
last. “Did you hear the talk that FKIP had sold the
<i>I Want Work</i> show?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They have sold it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe went numb. He said slowly: “Dennis didn’t call
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I saw the script, Joe; the part’s out.” Stella’s bird-like
voice fluttered. “Weren’t you the boy who was
pleading for a job for his father? The father’s working.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe drew a breath and the shock passed. He might
have guessed it was something like that. When you
were good enough for Wylie, you were good enough
for any of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Still hot with anticipation and expectation he came
down to Royal Street. Where now? Tony Vaux? He’d
already auditioned the Larry Logan part in the show
the Everts-Hall Agency was trying to build for the
He people; when Tony wanted more, he’d call. Vic
Wylie? Vic, producing an early afternoon show over
FFOM and a later show over FKIP, would be at
one of the stations in an agony of rehearsal. And yet
it was to Wylie’s office that the boy found himself
irresistibly drawn.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Robb typed in a deserted room. Somebody
coughed in the inner room and Joe looked in the
door. Archie Munn sat at a portable typewriter surrounded
by newspapers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are witnessing,” the actor announced gravely,
“the finish of one who might have been a brilliant
news commentator.” He took a page of script from
the typewriter and tore it in half. “FWWO’s filled
the spot. One of the <i>Journal’s</i> reporters. It’s not bad
publicity for the <i>Journal</i> and FWWO gets a free
news broadcast.” He looked at his watch. “Well,
somebody was thoughtful enough to die. I get a
funeral to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe stared.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pall-bearer,” Archie said, matter-of-factly. “You
have to own a tux. Three dollars for an afternoon
funeral service and five dollars for an evening
service.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was profoundly shocked. Why, Archie was
one of local radio’s stars. He said uncertainly, “You
mean—you have to?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The actor tapped a cigarette against the desk.
“Stella gets two nights a week as a waitress in an
all-night restaurant. Lucille thought she was all set
to go into a night club as a cigarette girl. The club
folded up.” A match flamed and touched the cigarette.
“I don’t have to do it, Joe. I love funerals. Didn’t
you know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>In two sentences Archie had painted a picture.
Once Joe would have said lightly: “That’s show business.”
Now he couldn’t be flippant. He knew it <i>was</i>
show business—their show business. Rehearsals for
hours, cutting platters that probably never sold, perhaps
playing a rôle in a sustaining show day after
day! And nobody paid you a dollar. Going hungry,
perhaps; washing out your single shirt, as Pop Bartell
did, and hanging it to dry while you slept. You
dug up a job so that you could eat, but it had to be
a skimpy, part-time job that permitted you to keep
body and soul together, and you lavished that body
and soul on radio. You lived on a sustaining hope, a
feverish, burning hope, that some day all the mean,
petty economies of small time would be behind you
and you’d know the glory of the fame of big time.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe said doggedly: “It won’t be that way with me.”
In Wylie’s book, he had top billing. If he was good
enough for Wylie, he was good enough for any of
them. Time would do it. He had made the rounds
to-day and had found nothing. But to-morrow....</p>

<p class='c010'>To-morrow became another yesterday, and then
another yesterday. A week passed. And still he had
nothing. Once John Dennis said an automatic “Have
a good summer?” as though forgetting this was not
his first visit.</p>

<p class='c010'>That was the day the sway of Joe’s shoulders lost
easy naturalness and became front. The bread-and-butter
tide had dwindled. Those no longer making
the rounds were working. Perhaps not getting any
money, but at least rehearsing and auditioning.
Archie Munn had caught on with a sponsored Sunday
show. Soon the commercials would all be cast.
After that there would be only occasional bits in
shows like <i>I Want Work</i>, or the sustaining shows,
originating in the studios, that paid only in experience.
And actors and actresses that the producers
had thus far discarded would still make the rounds,
and smile a smile that was becoming fixed and mechanical,
and pray for a chance at even these starvation
crumbs.</p>

<p class='c010'>In show business, Joe told himself, you had to get
the breaks. The breaks hadn’t yet come. They would.
Either Wylie had judgment or he hadn’t. The boy
was sure he had. He believed in Wylie. And yet, to-day when he reached the building that housed Vic
Wylie Productions, he could not go in. With the red-headed,
dynamic producer present the office was
magnetized; with Wylie absent, the place was only
four barren walls. He couldn’t stand barrenness—too
many other things were barren. Undecided, he kept
walking and approached his father’s store. He
thought with surprise, “I always seem to end up here
when show business gets tough.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The display in the immaculate cases down the
center of the room had been changed once more.
Black lettering on a card said simply: SCHOOL
DAYS. The cases held fountain pens, typewriters,
leather brief-cases, book-ends, and desk sets. Joe
thought: “Dad certainly is up to the minute.” But
it was toward the book department that he went
at once.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Fairchild was taking some books from the
shelves and placing them on the reduced-price table.
“Joe,” he said, “don’t ask me if we’re selling any
books. The subject is painful.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The jackets of books made exciting, vivid splashes
of color along the shelves. Titles paraded in rows,
quickening, challenging, and mysterious. Books and
radio again began to tumble about in Joe’s mind
as they had tumbled before. Thomas Carlin Presents
To-day’s Book.... But his father had said that the
cost of a once-a-week would be prohibitive. And yet,
if there was a way to tell people about a grand
book.... But how could you tell them so that they’d
want to read the book?</p>

<p class='c010'>The door of his father’s office was closed. Shadows
 moved upon the glass.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who’s in with Dad, Mr. Fairchild?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’re carrying a new typewriter. An official of
the company’s down to talk advertising appropriation
with your father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If we advertise the typewriter, the company’ll pay
part of the cost.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s their typewriter, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe stared at the shelves. Books and radio were
doing another tumble through his mind. His breath
quickened.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clerks covered the cases with dusters at the closing
hour and came back to the rear.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you on the air, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What program? I keep tuning, but I don’t get
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What happens in radio, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Sitting on a table in the book department Joe
described rehearsals, sponsor auditions, the cutting
of a platter. He told them about Vic Wylie and Tony
Vaux. But he did not tell them that this was all small
time and that show people in small time radio had to
piece out their incomes as pallbearers, and as night-shift
waitresses, and as cigarette girls in night
clubs.</p>

<p class='c010'>The advertising discussion in his father’s office
ended. Tom Carlin came upon a rapt group in the
book department.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Trying to lure my boys into radio, Joe?” he asked
dryly.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the men laughed. “It sounds exciting, Mr.
Carlin, but I prefer my own job.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Whatever Tom Carlin started to say was bitten
back. Father and son left to get the car.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dad, you said a show would cost too much....”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin laughed. “When you get your teeth
in, you hang on, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How much would it cost?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know. I learned what radio time would
cost. I stopped right there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suppose you plugged a book. Would the publisher
go in with you? It’s their book.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Assume,” his father said at last, “that I wrote to
a publisher. He’d want to know what kind of show.
Well, what kind?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe had no answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>After supper he turned on the radio. He swung
from station to station, recognizing the cast of every
local show. The old hunger was on him. How close
had he come to getting any of these parts, or had he
been considered at all?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe,” his mother said gently, “you look done in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Not done in, he told himself; discouraged. He
couldn’t shake off a sense of shock. Archie Munn
picking up a few stray dollars as a pallbearer!</p>

<p class='c010'>The telephone rang.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe,” Tony Vaux said jovially, “I’m calling you
and Pop in for a reading. The He people are warming
up. Early. About nine-thirty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was no longer discouraged. “An audition,” he
called back over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010'>The bell rang again.</p>

<p class='c010'>This time Lucille Borden’s voice sang over the
telephone. “Joe, I’m rushed; only a minute. N.B.C.’s
called me to New York for a committee audition.
Wish me luck.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe didn’t know what a committee audition was.
But whatever it was, it was good. The people Wylie
picked were beginning to get the breaks. They were
going places.</p>

<p class='c010'>The morning brought one of those dark days of
lowering skies and gray gloom. Pop Bartell was already
at the Everts-Hall Agency, his one shirt spotless.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hear about Lucille?” Tony Vaux boomed. “The
first local artist to get a committee audition in three
years.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is a committee audition?” Joe asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The real thing, Joe. One producer hears your first
reading at N.B.C. If he turns you down, you can’t
go back for a year. If he passes you along, you’re
called before a committee of five producers. Usually
you’re called back in a week. Somebody must have
slipped on Lu.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought with envy: “Five producers; big time.”
His heart lifted. Good luck, Lucille!</p>

<p class='c010'>Ceiling lights burned in the room, and the misty
day, dark and damp, pressed against the windows.
Pop was as slim and straight, as sprightly and spry, as
a stripling. Joe scanned the <i>Bush-League Larry</i>
script:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Sound—Train Coming on Mike and Stopping at Station</span></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Conductor</span> (above escaping steam): Ticeville.
Here’s where you get off, young fellow. All a-a-aboard.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sound—Train Panting Leaves Station. Fade to</span></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ike</span>: Looking for somebody, stranger?</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Larry</span>: I’m looking for Bud Wilson.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ike</span>: If you’re a salesman trying to sell Bud
some baseball equipment, you’re wasting your
time. Bud’s Ticeville team ain’t been doing so
good. When a team in these parts don’t win—</p>

<p class='c013'>Tony said with a chuckle: “All right, folks. Take
me out to the ball game.” He made sound effects of a
sort and Pop Bartell came in on his cue:</p>

<p class='c014'>Looking for somebody, stranger?</p>

<p class='c013'>Joe was surprised by the character richness of the
old man’s voice. He thought: “Pop, this is going to be
swell.” He spoke his own line:</p>

<p class='c014'>I’m looking for Bud Wilson.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pop was on the mike again:</p>

<p class='c014'>If you’re a salesman trying to sell Bud some
base—ball e—equipment, you’re waste—you’re
wasting your time. Bud’s Tice—ville team ain’t—been
going so good—</p>

<p class='c013'>All the smooth, rich flow was gone. Pop, stumbling,
sounded like a novice with stage fright. Tony Vaux’s
red face had become a mottled red.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the matter with you, Pop? Can’t you read
your lines?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pop drew himself up. “I can always read my lines.
A slight indisposition. I assure you I shall be myself
directly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you sick?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tony!” Joe’s voice was impulsive. “Give him more
light.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Red-faced, Tony looked at the boy and then at
the dark day grown darker. He crossed the room
and brought back a standing lamp.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Try it again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Somebody came into the room. Pop’s voice, enriched
by forty years of acting, rolled out the lines
once more, gave them a tang and a flavor. And yet
there came to Joe, as the reading went on, a sense
of something missed, of something that did not quite
touch. He made his last speech.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vic Wylie, rumpled and tense, was in the room.
Tony Vaux scratched his chin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you think of it, Vic?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie was abrupt. “I never poke a finger in another
man’s show. You know that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony took a fat cigar from his bulging vest and
chewed off the end. “What’s wrong with it?” He
raised plump hands toward Joe and Pop. “Now, now,
folks. I don’t mean it’s a bad show. It’s like one of
these salads that need a pinch more of this or a pinch
less of that.” He puffed on the cigar.</p>

<div id='i157'  class='figcenter id009'>
<img src='images/img-157.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Now, now, folks,” Tony Vaux said. “I don’t mean it’s a bad show.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Joe began a hesitant: “Perhaps—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Again, Joe?” Tony chuckled. “What is it this
time?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps Mr. Bartell comes in too fast. He’s supposed
to be a retired old man with no worries except
baseball. Sits around in the shade and enjoys life.
Never in a hurry—that’s what I mean. Doesn’t Pop
come in too crisply? You sort of lose the mellow,
unhurried old man. If he came in leisurely, a little
drawly....”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe knew that Vic Wylie was watching him intently.
Had he been too free with his opinion? Tony
rolled the cigar across his lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Give it a go, Pop.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was amazed at the changed shading, the difference
in timing, that Pop gave his lines. He didn’t
have to wonder if this were better. Vic Wylie would
still have struggled for greater perfection; but Tony
Vaux, rocking back and forth on his heels, exuded
a bluff, red-faced pleasure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Folks,” he said heartily, “that’s a show. If the He
people don’t cool off, we’ll lay them in the aisles.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought: “That’s always the trouble with show
business—the if.” You had to sell a sponsor while he
was hot; next day or next week he began to wonder
if the show was as good as he had thought. That was
the sticker with <i>Sue Davis Against the World</i>. Too
much time had passed since the audition. And these
two shows were the only hopes he had.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pop Bartell departed. Joe had a shrewd idea the
old actor would have nothing to do with eye-glasses.
Glasses would take from his front of lingering, gallant
youth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The door closed slowly as Joe followed Pop. Vic
Wylie’s rasp of irritation was audible:</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ve heard <i>One Man’s Family</i>, Tony? A honey
of a script, but what a cast. Without a cast, what
have you? I’m standing pat. Munson’s option on <i>Sue
Davis</i> runs out Monday. Monday I’m throwing the
show open.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The door closed with a soft click and Tony’s reply
was lost. But to Joe the dark day was no longer
dark. There was still hope. This was Tuesday. Six
more days to Monday.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pop Bartell waited outside the building in the
street. “Joe, I happen to find myself in a little difficulty.
Momentarily, you understand; only momentarily.
A mere trifle. I expect to be called for a part.
Could you—” The old man coughed. “Only until I’m
called for the part, of course. Do you—” Again the
cough. “Do you happen to have a spare dollar?”</p>

<p class='c010'>This, Joe thought with a pang, was what a good
trouper came to after forty years. “Make it two dollars,
Mr. Bartell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe, you place me eternally in your debt. As soon
as I’m working—” Pop Bartell went off through Royal
Street, his stride youthful.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again on Wednesday, Joe made the rounds in
vain. There was no word from Tony Vaux. Thursday
was also barren. He counted days. Four more
days left of the Munson option.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thursday Lucille Borden returned from her
N.B.C. audition in New York looking tired and pale.
Make-up could not completely hide her pallor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One of the producers liked my work,” she said.
“He held me over another day for a sponsor
audition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>That meant big time. Joe asked eagerly: “Did it
go?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Infant,” Lucille drawled, “a sponsor audition gives
you a beautiful view of a lot of frozen faces.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe knew. He had had one sponsor audition.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then it was Friday. The days of hope had
dwindled to three. The searching bread-and-butter
hunters had developed a stock question. Joe heard
it on Royal Street and in the elevators. “Anything
yet?” And there was a stock reply that fooled nobody,
that was part of the front. “No, but I’m expecting
a part next week.” Pop Bartell expected a part next
week. Joe knew it was all hollow and unreal.</p>

<p class='c010'>John Dennis was not at his office at FKIP. His secretary
said: “Mr. Dennis has you down for something.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll be back,” Joe told her. Perhaps, he thought
in growing disillusionment, Dennis wanted to ask
him had he had a good summer. He went on to
FFOM and from there to FWWO.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gillis said: “Two o’clock to-morrow, Carlin. We
have an open spot that must be filled in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A sustaining show that would pay no salary. And
yet Joe walked out going hot and cold by turns. His
first call from a station since the <i>I Want Work</i> platter.
True, one of the smallest stations in the city, but
a call. Now, if there was something at FKIP.... Not
wanting to miss Dennis again he called from a booth
in the lower hall.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe,” said John Dennis, “I have a part I want
to hear you read.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s hand was hot on the receiver. “To-day?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-morrow at two.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe sighed. “I’m auditioning at two to-morrow.”
He came out of the booth. What should he have
done, called off the FWWO audition and gone over
to the more important FKIP? Or did you cancel once
you’d told a station you’d be in?</p>

<p class='c010'>Saturday he was at FWWO at a quarter to two.
The Munson time had shrunk to two days. There
were four people in Gillis’ office, three actresses and
an actor. Joe had met them all, on and off, at Wylie’s
during the summer.</p>

<p class='c010'>The clock moved around to 2:30. Gillis did not
appear.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is this another FWWO over-ripe tangerine?” a
voice asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>At three o’clock Gillis walked into the office.
“Sorry,” he said gruffly. “I had an idea for a swell
show.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it off, Gil?” one of the actresses asked. Her
voice was dead.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Upstairs changed its mind and gave it the hot
foot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The cast filed out. Joe was torn with helpless resentment
and aching disappointment. His first call.
And he had turned down FKIP—for this.</p>

<p class='c010'>A morbid curiosity sent him to the FKIP Building.
Dennis was rehearsing in Studio B. One look through
the glass-walled gallery, and the boy’s sense of loss
grew. Archie Munn was in the cast, and Stella Joyce,
and Lucille Borden. When you had a chance with a
cast like that....</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently the rehearsal was over. Dennis gathered
up script and went out through the empty control-room.
Joe walked to the door through which Archie
and the others would come to the gallery.</p>

<p class='c010'>The door opened before he reached it. Archie
Munn hurried through the gallery, disappeared into
the reception-room, and hurried back in a few moments
with a glass of water. Studio B received him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mystified, Joe looked in through the glass. Lucille
sat in a chair and Stella stood beside her. Lucille
drank the water slowly, looked up at Stella, and tried
to smile. Archie came out into the gallery.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anything wrong?” Joe asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lu said she felt faint.” Preoccupied, the actor took
a cigarette from his pocket, held it unlighted in his
hand, and seemed to talk to himself. “That New
York audition took an extra day. She had to go to a
hotel. She was probably down to some loose silver
when she got back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was still mystified.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s not much nourishment in a roll and a cup
of coffee,” Archie Munn said bitterly.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sun touched one side of Royal Street, and the
Saturday shopping crowds moved leisurely. Joe, his
head bent, moved numbly with the crowd. Stanch,
warm-hearted Lucille Borden! She hadn’t worked
since June, and the night club had gone into bankruptcy,
and the <i>Years of Danger</i> show hadn’t gone
back on the air. He bit his lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lights burned behind the glass door that said:
VIC WYLIE PRODUCTIONS. The producer, in the
inner room, was at the telephone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Robb’s on her way over with an envelop,
Arch. Take Lu to a restaurant. Give her the envelop
and send her home in a cab.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was motionless, silent. Wylie put down the
telephone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Arch tells me you were there, kid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The producer sat with his head in his hands. “She’s
a type,” he said harshly in the silence. “She hasn’t
much range. But give her a type part she fits and
they don’t come any better. You hear that, kid? They
don’t come any better. Look what happens to her.
You think that’s rare? You don’t know the stories
small-time radio can tell. Why do they stay in it?
Oh, I know. The big time. It’s a dream; it’s like a
drug. Not one in a thousand ever cracks the big
time. I’m sick of watching them trying to live on
crumbs. I’m fed up. But I can’t get out. My father
and my mother were show people; I was born in a
theatrical boarding-house. I toddled across a stage
when I was five years old.” His head snapped up
fiercely. “What else do I know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The telephone rang.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe stumbled out. He bumped into a chair and
pushed it aside. His throat was choked. He was waiting
at the elevators when Wylie’s entrance door
swung open.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kid, come back here. Come back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe went back.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie grabbed him by the shoulders. “That was
Tony, kid. Munson’s signed. It’s in the bag and the
string’s tied. A thirteen-week try-out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe had often tried to imagine what this moment
would be like. His first contract; his first show. Now
that the moment had come, he could not rise to what
the moment demanded. He was thinking of Lucille.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We go on the air Monday week. Rehearsals start
to-morrow. All day. We’ll give them a show, kid,
that’ll rock the town.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gone was the black depression. Wylie’s eyes blazed
with excitement. He began to laugh as though Lucille
Borden did not exist.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Joe knew better. Somebody had once told him
that Wylie took care of his people. Lucille was one
of Wylie’s people, and, spontaneously, his hand had
gone into his pocket for her. Another page was filled
in the boy’s book of understanding and experience.
Day after day you witnessed contradictions. You
marveled at outbursts of temperament, mercurial and
erratic. You watched an old trouper stride along
Royal Street owning the world because he had two
dollars. You soared in the clouds and you plunged
down into the depths. You were in show business.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER 8</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Joe Carlin thought he knew the harsh exactitude
of Vic Wylie’s demands. Hadn’t he already rehearsed
for Wylie? But those rehearsals had been for the
<i>Sue Davis</i> show at a time when it might never reach
a sponsor audition. This was the prelude to a <i>Sue
Davis</i> show actually going on the air. In the past
Wylie had been an unremitting slave driver. Now
he became a sarcastic, sneering, insulting monster.
Each hour he seemed to find words that made the
last hour’s ordeal seem tame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“After a season with Vic,” Stella Joyce fluttered,
“your skin is gone. You turn to leather.”</p>

<p class='c010'>You had to be tough, Joe thought, to take it. That
first rehearsal was held in an office building quiet
with the Sunday hush. Only one elevator was in
service. But the suite of Vic Wylie Productions was
articulate with the heart-rending echo of the producer’s
suffering and anguish.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beginning at nine o’clock the rehearsal ran, with
a few scattered rest periods, until early in the afternoon.
Sometimes they spent half an hour on a dozen
lines. “No, no,” Wylie moaned. “You’re driving me
to murder. I could get away with it, too—nobody’d
ever miss you. And if they did discover the bodies
I’d get a public vote of thanks. Why do you give me
da-da-da-das? I want blood in it. I want it human. I
want it to have feeling and life.” Once he took Stella’s
part and read a scene. He was a man, and his voice
was grotesque in a mother’s rôle, but he managed to
throw a ray of illumination on the part. Every line he
spoke took on unexpected possibilities. And once he
stormed out and slammed the door, and sulked in the
outer office for ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole cast was assembled—Stella, Joe, an actor
named Bert Farr who played the heavy, and two
minor characters. Previously, Joe had read from three
scattered scripts; to-day he began to get the <i>Sue
Davis</i> story. A widow, after the death of her husband,
comes with her son to her sole inheritance, a run-down
cottage in a small, hidden, mountain village.
But plenty of land goes with the cottage, and the
dead husband had a passionate faith in its future.
Some day a highway would come over the mountain
and run past the door. Some day that land, cleared
and level, would be the spot for a profitable gas-station
tea-room tourist-cabin business. And so the
widow and her son struggle to keep the little that
is theirs and dream of the day when that little may
be great. But a local skinflint, Israel Tice, played
by Bert Farr, also knows the potential value of the
property and schemes to secure the ownership. That
was as far as Curt Lake, the script-writer, had gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What happens later?” Joe asked during one of the
rest periods. “Does Sue open a tea-room?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie snarled: “Worry about the script you’re
reading.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They stopped for lunch and were working again
within an hour. The respite seemed to soothe Wylie
into amiability. For fifteen or twenty minutes the rehearsal
was unruffled and serene. With Joe reading,
the producer all at once became a hair-tearing
maniac.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mo—ther!” His stinging burlesque had just
enough of truth to be perfect. “Do we have to have
that again? Do you think you’re cast as a babe in
arms? Do you want Stella to rock you and lullaby
you to sleep? How often do I have to tell you?” A
bony forefinger was a spike in Joe’s face. “Give me
the ‘Mother’ I want.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe gave it.</p>

<p class='c010'>At half-past ten they stopped. Circles had formed
under Stella’s eyes. Joe’s head was light.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I have to go through this for thirteen weeks,”
Wylie moaned. “I’m buying coffee and sandwiches.
Who’s coming?”</p>

<p class='c010'>They all went with him. In the restaurant he took
a script from the brief-case and pored over it. “Ah!”
He was on fire as though this were the beginning of
the day. “Suppose we play it this way?” He read a
scene, interpreting all the characters and etching the
lines with a changed sense of value. But, brain-fagged,
they could only goggle at him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t ask us to go back,” Bert Farr pleaded.
“We’ve been going for almost twelve hours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie, smoldering, stuffed the script back into the
case. “Nine to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vic!” Stella protested.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie glared at her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella’s laugh was resigned. “All right, Vic; nine
to-morrow.” Waiting with Joe for a bus she said:
“This period’s the hardest. After the show’s on a week
or two it shakes down and the cast falls into a
rhythm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Rehearsals became a nightmare. Joe got so he
dreamed rehearsals. Rehearsals in the morning until
Wylie had to rush off for the first of his two shows;
rehearsals after the second show until, sometime in
the night, weariness halted them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tuesday Curt Lake, the script writer, brought in
more script. “How is it going, Vic?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The producer held his head. “It reeks. I’m afraid
to open the windows for fear the city’ll back in a
garbage truck.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, on Saturday, Vic Wylie ceased to be a fiend.
The rehearsal shifted to Studio B at FKIP, and a
sound engineer joined the cast to give the show its
sound effects. The producer knew he had molded
them as far as they could be molded. What he had
now was what he would get Monday. Monday he
wanted them easy and relaxed. And so, as they read
the opening script three times, he was mild, almost
gentle. On Sunday they ran through the script only
once.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe Carlin no longer stalked the broadcasting stations
for a part. The early days of a Wylie show left
you time only for Wylie. The need to hunt bread
and butter at FKIP was past. He was on an FKIP
commercial; he had the station’s attention. Later,
he’d call in once a week at FFOM and FWWO.
Munson might drop the show after thirteen weeks,
and it was wise to make the rounds and keep in
touch.</p>

<p class='c010'>Monday the walls of the Carlin house pressed in
upon him and suffocated him. He watched the clock,
he kept roaming upstairs and down, he turned the
radio on and off. Vic’s two o’clock show was on at
FFOM, his four o’clock at FKIP. <i>Sue Davis</i> went on
the air at four-thirty. But Wylie would have to walk
only from one FKIP studio to another.</p>

<p class='c010'>How would it go? The house became unbearable.
He called: “You won’t forget to listen, Mother?”
and was gone. Afterward he was never able to remember
whether the day had been clear or drab.
Stella Joyce was in Wylie’s inner office reading script.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here’s yours, Joe. Vic’s incoherent. He timed the
show for a minute opening announcement, but the
agency changed to a two-minute Munson plug. Curt
Lake had to rewrite script.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was scared. If Vic tried to jam them through
a last minute rehearsal just before they went on....</p>

<p class='c010'>“No new business,” Stella said. “Curt had to drop
lines.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was relieved. After that he waited with growing
impatience. Stella picked up a magazine from
Wylie’s desk and turned the pages idly. There was
an awful emptiness in the boy’s stomach. Was she
watching the time? Presently the actress put the
magazine down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe,” she said impulsively, “I’m glad you’re playing
this. If Sonny Baker were in town, Amby would
probably have sold him to Munson. Vic would have
auditioned him. He might have walked off with it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I followed him in <i>City Boy</i> last season,” Joe said
soberly. Against his three months of radio experience,
Sonny could show two years. “I thought he was good.
Is he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella nodded. “Quite upstage, but good. Lucille
despises him. He’s a show stealer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He won’t steal this one,” said Joe and followed
the girl out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Studio B was dark. Stella turned on lights. The
sound engineer’s equipment was already in place.
A clock in the control-room told them they had an
hour to wait. Bert Farr arrived and was followed by
two minor characters.</p>

<p class='c010'>A page opened the door from the gallery. “Mr.
Wylie wants a cast report.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All ready,” said Stella.</p>

<p class='c010'>The afternoon they had given the Munson audition,
with listeners in chairs along the walls, chairs
and people had seemed to hem them in closely. This
afternoon, with only the cast of five present, Studio
B was a yawning cavern. Joe felt swallowed up,
shrunken, and small. Had the clock stopped? Nervous,
he took script from his pocket.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t do that,” Stella warned. “You’re perfect in
the part. You’ll confuse yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bert Farr said: “Four o’clock. Vic’s other show’s
on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Half an hour more! In reception-hall, corridors,
elevators, and lobby the Vic Wylie show was coming
out of FKIP speakers. Here there was only silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sound engineer arrived. An announcer strolled
in and walked about, looking bored.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The other show’s off,” said Farr.</p>

<p class='c010'>The tips of Joe’s fingers were ice. If the other
show was off, where was Vic?</p>

<p class='c010'>The control-room began to fill as it fills for an
opening. The technician who would regulate volume
came in first. Munson arrived with the President and
the Vice-President of FKIP. John Dennis was there
next with Curt Lake. People gathered in the gallery
and stared in through the glass.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then a storm burst upon them, and the storm was
Wylie. His face was lined with strain. “Everybody
got the new script?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Everybody had.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Watch the control-room. Come in on my signs.
Don’t start too fast. You’ll be in the groove in half
a minute.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie was gone, to appear next in the control-room.
And now, in the deeper, significant silence,
Farr cleared his throat.</p>

<p class='c010'>A minute to go. To Joe, that became the longest
minute he had lived. The cast gathered at the mike.
There was a moment when he thought he was choking.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly the silence was broken. The announcer
was reading:</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-night Munson brings you the opening chapter
of Curt Lake’s radio drama, Sue Davis Against the
World, the story of a widowed mother’s struggle—”</p>

<p class='c010'>An incredulous voice cried out in Joe: “You’re on
the air!”</p>

<p class='c010'>It became unbelievable. Actually on the air! And
then everything became unreal. Vic Wylie, glaring
through the glass panels of the control-room, became
a distorted Vic Wylie; the announcer’s voice hung
lingeringly in space. Wylie’s commanding finger took
on a dreamy haziness. The finger wavered away from
the announcer and indicated Stella. Joe’s eyes were
wide open and staring as though he were in a trance.
In a queer sort of drugged fog he thought: “My cue’s
coming.” The finger, as though moving leisurely in
a timeless arc, wavered toward him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He began to read his part. There was no nervousness
nor anxiety. There was only that hypnotic sense
of unreality:</p>

<p class='c010'>Mother, don’t shake your head at me like
that. You must listen—</p>

<p class='c010'>He did not know that he had become an automaton.
He did not know that he was suffering a
form of mike fright that afflicts the young radio performer
with an emotional paralysis. But Wylie had
pounded at him, rehearsal after rehearsal, until a pattern
had been carved deep in his mind. Subconsciously,
his mind reproduced that pattern as though
it were a platter. He read as Wylie had insisted that
he read.</p>

<p class='c010'>By and by all the dream-world voices were gone,
and there was silence. People began to leave the control-room.
Joe drew a breath and reality came rushing
back upon him. Why, it was over. He’d been on
the air—and it was over. All he could remember was
fog and haze.</p>

<p class='c010'>A wise, knowing Vic Wylie, who could be as tender
as a woman, was in the studio. “All right now, kid?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What—what happened to me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Something that happens to most of them. You
came through, and it’ll never happen again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe wanted to ask a question and didn’t dare.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie didn’t have to be asked. “You were tops,
kid.” He smiled at the cast, and his haggard face was
lighted. “You were all tops. Get something to eat and
report at six.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How about all eating together?” Stella asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In a minute,” Joe told her. It was still all unbelievable.
He squeezed into a telephone-booth. How could
you be tops when you didn’t know what it had all
been about? He dialed a number.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How was it, Mother?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe!” That was all Kate Carlin could say for a
moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you like it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was splendid. Dad wants to speak to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin said gruffly: “Until to-night, Joe, I
thought you were making a mistake.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe knew the end of doubt. Then it had been good!
Glowing, he pushed back the door. Little Ambrose
Carver waited for him ten feet from the booth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Congratulations, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thanks, Amby.” He hadn’t expected this. The
glow deepened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does Amby know how to pick them? I’m asking
you if I’m a picker.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You certainly are.” If Amby wanted to be friends,
why not? Joe was in a mood to give friendship to all
the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Didn’t I predict you’d go up in lights?” The
Carver cane gave a jaunty wriggle. “Don’t forget to
tell the Everts-Hall Agency I have a ten per cent
piece of you, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was deflated. Amby’s wait had been a money
wait; Amby might really think he’d laid an egg. It
didn’t matter. Nothing mattered but Vic, and Vic
said he was tops.</p>

<p class='c010'>An hour and a half later this same Vic Wylie was
savagely, brutally rehearsing the next day’s show
and wailing his torment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Studio B to-morrow morning for the dress,” he
told them finally and dropped into a chair. “You
need three more hours of rehearsal. You’re not ready
for a dress. What can I do about it? I can’t give you
all my time; I have two other shows.” His eyes closed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you eat?” Stella asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>The producer’s eyes opened vaguely. “Did I? I
forget. Don’t bother me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe went out and brought back coffee and sandwiches.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Leave them there,” said Wylie. He had whipped
himself back to work and was reading script.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eat them now,” Joe insisted. “The coffee’ll get
cold.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Another one who thinks I need looking after,”
Wylie snarled. But he ate. “Kid, don’t pay much attention
to me when I blow my top. Everybody in
show business is nuts.”</p>

<p class='c010'>If being nuts was the price of show business success,
Joe was willing to be nuts. There was no second
attack of mike fright. He came to know a certain
tension just before the show and during the broadcast,
but that was a quickening excitement that filled
him with fire. Studio B became easy, familiar ground,
and he was on terms of intimacy with every announcer,
and every studio producer in the city.</p>

<p class='c010'>Life took on a deep, satisfying richness. The radio
columns of the <i>Journal</i> gave him attention. He began
to get fan mail. Royal Street was paved with gold,
and the FKIP Building was a gleaming tower.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there were others who still walked Royal Street
looking for parts; there were actors and actresses
who would always be walking Royal Street. Archie
Munn had picked up a few bits, in addition to his
Sunday show, and was getting by. Lucille Borden, a
type player, had found nothing. No station had a
show that needed her type.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mamma,” she announced casually after <i>Sue Davis</i>
had been on a week, “is going to sell hosiery for Mr.
Munson. Until a part turns up. Main floor, section
twelve—in case you want to buy silk stockings, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And Wylie had said she was one of the best.
N.B.C. had approved her at a committee audition.
Joe blurted: “If I were a producer, you’d be working.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Infant,” Lucille said softly, “don’t let it get in
your hair. This won’t be the first time I’ve crawled
out on a life-line.” She bit her lip. “It probably won’t
be the last.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe threw off a wave of bleakness. You couldn’t
do anything about it—it was show business. But after
that, though each day brought its zest, its rush of
wonder, his exhilaration over being on the air was
tempered and subdued.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Sue Davis</i> show clicked. The Everts-Hall
Agency compiled figures: the show had caught the
public. Munson’s accountants compiled more figures:
the show was selling merchandise. A show that
clicked both ways might be good for forty weeks.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe Carlin became seasoned, seasoned and
smooth. At least, he told himself confidently he was
becoming smooth. But gradually the restless feet
of show people had dulled the bright gold of Royal
Street. What had been gold to him, he saw, was
merely cold stone pavement to many others. Actors,
always glib about the part they expected next week,
began to buttonhole him in the corridors of the
broadcasting company buildings and lead him into
quiet corners. He lent them money. For a week
he bought Pop Bartell’s lunch.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Any day now,” Pop would say, gallant and optimistic,
“Tony’ll be calling us into audition for the
He people.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe always agreed. He didn’t believe it. <i>Bush-League
Larry</i> had been on the fire too long.</p>

<p class='c010'>October crept toward its end and Indian summer
lingered in the city. The afternoon broadcast, the evening
rehearsal, the morning dress, fan mail and
occasional calls at FFOM and FWWO filled Joe’s day
completely. Fan mail was a late development. At
first he had answered the letters himself, proud and
thrilled. But his mail had grown, and now it was
handled from the Everts-Hall Agency on Munson
stationery. He hadn’t visited his father’s store in
weeks. Show business engrossed him completely. If
he thought at all of books and how his father might
sell more books the thought was a shadow, gone as
quickly as it had come.</p>

<p class='c010'>Early in November the cast finished a Monday
broadcast and was gathering up hats and coats when
Wylie walked into Studio B. Usually, the appearance
of the producer immediately after a show ended
meant that something had gone wrong. The cast
waited for the storm.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no storm. Wylie said: “Tony tells me
Munson’s signing the show for another twenty-six
weeks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The new contract would carry the show into June.
Eight months of freedom from the bread-and-butter
hunt! Bert Farr and Stella jitterbugged up and down
the studio. Joe pranced to the piano shoved into a
corner and banged out a one-finger melody. People
gathered in the gallery. But they were used to people
gaping in through the glass; they forgot they were
there.</p>

<p class='c010'>A page opened the studio door. “Telephone, Mr.
Wylie. Your office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie left them. After that the celebration died
down. Joe was slipping into a top-coat when a voice,
cracked and high-pitched, swung him around.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kid!” Wylie was wild-eyed. “Munson’s closes in
ten minutes. Get a message to Lucille. N.B.C. wants
her. A contract. She’s hit the jackpot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vic!” Stella cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was already on his way. Lucille Borden without
a part in small-time radio; Lucille Borden,
hungry; Lucille Borden behind a counter selling
stockings. And then, when nobody expected it, Lucille
Borden in the big time. Show business! The
down elevator stopped at every floor and passengers
took their time getting on and off. Joe stewed. The
Munson store was only half a block away but, reaching
the street, he ran.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lucille Borden, arranging boxes of hosiery, smiled
at him. “Stockings, Infant? Don’t tell me you have a
sweetie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Words poured from Joe. “N.B.C. wants you. They
called Vic’s office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The smile was gone. “Another audition?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A part. The show sold. You’re in, Lu.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lucille Borden’s hands gripped the edge of the
counter; the knuckles turned white. She said slowly:
“At last.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As though in celebration of Lucille’s triumph, the
morrow dawned in golden splendor; but as Joe rode
downtown the day became clouded and gray. The
dress rehearsal at Studio B went off without a hitch.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kid,” Wylie said, “Lu leaves on the three o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe stopped at the Everts-Hall Agency to sign the
fan mail replies. Lucille Borden on a coast-to-coast!
One of Wylie’s people. If you were good enough for
Wylie.... The pen that wrote “Joe Carlin” wasn’t
steady. He was one of Wylie’s people.</p>

<p class='c010'>Walking into Wylie’s office and finding Lucille,
Stella, and Archie Munn already there brought back
the long, idle days of the summer when they had
always been together. In the rush of eager talk yesterday’s
hard road was forgotten; nobody thought
of lunch. Stella, called for an audition at FFOM, was
the first to leave; Archie, with a bit on a two o’clock
FWWO show, soon followed. Joe carried Lucille’s
bags to the station.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll be listening,” he said. “Not only the opening—every
day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Infant,” Lucille said with a catch in her voice,
“I’m going to miss my old gang.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A mist was falling when Joe came out of the station.
Then, while he was still two blocks from the
FKIP Building, the skies opened and the mist became
a torrent of rain. Royal Street broke into confusion
with everybody running and getting in
everybody else’s way. A river poured down upon
him. Wet and cold, he reached Studio B.</p>

<p class='c010'>The studio was warm. He would, Joe decided,
jump home when the show ended, change, and hurry
back for the evening rehearsal; but by the time <i>Sue
Davis Against the World</i> signed off his chill had
passed and he went to supper with Stella. For once
the evening rehearsal was short. The cast sat around
for an hour, and Vic sat with them, and they talked
of Lucille Borden and the big time. Joe’s clothing
had dried.</p>

<p class='c010'>He awakened to a new day with the early sun in
his eyes. He said aloud: “I’m hungry enough to
eat—” The words died away, and he lay rigid. Had
that hoarse rasp come from him? He said again: “I’m
hungry enough—” His body broke out in a sweat. At
nine o’clock, worried and shaken, he walked into
Wylie’s office.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vic.” His voice was down to a whisper.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vic Wylie’s face paled. “You got wet yesterday,”
he croaked, and then he went into a frenzy. “Miss
Robb! Dr. Zinn—twelfth floor. I’m coming right up.”
He dragged Joe toward the hall. Twenty minutes
later he was back, a wild-eyed lunatic. “Get Curt
Lake.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The stenographer made the call. “No answer,” she
reported.</p>

<p class='c010'>The producer pounded her desk. “Find him; find
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Robb “found” him. Curt Lake arrived out of
breath.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Laryngitis,” the producer croaked. “The house
sold out and the kid gets laryngitis. The part’s got to
be dropped. I’ve got to have new script. You see
what time it is?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The script-writer whipped out of his coat. “Two
o’clock, Vic?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“With the show going on at four-thirty? Can I send
them on cold? I want script at noon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Noon? Do you think I pick ideas out of the air?
You’ll want another script to-night for to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do I get script or do I get an alibi?” Wylie
screamed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Radio’s absolute master, the clock, was goading
them with pressure and tension. Come high water
or low, storm or calm, sickness or health, at four-thirty
the Munson show had to go on.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Robb appeared and closed the inner office
door. Joe thought with useless regret: “If I hadn’t
gone to the train....” Curt Lake was scowling and
Wylie was glaring.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly Wylie was halfway across the desk.
“How is this, Curt? In the story you’ve had this son
soaking stamps off discarded envelopes, pasting them
in an album—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The script-writer swung around eagerly. “That’s
it, Vic. Last night we left them in a bad way. Almost
broke, and the guy that wants the property putting
on the pressure. The son’s desperate. He decides to
take his stamp collection to a dealer in the city, two
hundred miles away. He’s already gone when the
script opens—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A kid without money? How you going to get him
there? Pullman?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can’t he hike? Can’t he thumb rides?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you nuts? Don’t you know hitch-hiking’s in
bad? Do you want the Woman’s Club and the P.T.A.
on our necks?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you want a script?” Curt Lake shouted. “Put
him on a bus and he’s there to-day and home to-morrow.
How long is Joe’s throat going to keep him
out? How many miles does a hitch-hiker make? It’s
all luck, isn’t it—who picks him up and how far
they’re going. We can string it along as far as you
need it. If Joe’s throat takes a week he’s away a week.
He sends back post cards to his mother. He’s off
stage, but we keep the spot on him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s your curtain?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Rain. Some swell sound effects. Night and mother
alone. She opens the door and listens to the rain.
Buckets of rain. You get it, Vic? ‘Where is my wandering
boy to-night?’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I get it,” Wylie snarled. “The last script-writer
who used it was shot. He deserved it.” He clawed
for his hat, clawed for his coat, clawed for the half-open,
bulging brief-case. “It’s corny,” he groaned
from the door, “but it’s a script.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Curt Lake stormed out to Miss Robb. “Does he
expect me to give him an Orson Welles show in an
hour and fifty minutes?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll give him a script, won’t you, Mr. Lake?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vic?” The man was amazed at the question. “I’d
give him my right arm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was madly unbelievable, fantastic and unreal—and
yet so very real. It was show business.</p>

<p class='c010'>Curt Lake paced the inner office. He sat before
the typewriter, pecked at the keys, paced restlessly
once more. He ripped off his tie. He drummed on the
window, swore fervently, and opened his shirt. Suddenly
he was back at the machine and talking to himself.
His fingers began to pound. When he finished,
shortly before noon, he had a pile of manuscript.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe asked in a hoarse whisper: “Script finished?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Script?” Curt Lake’s voice was thick with scorn.
“It’s tripe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Listening to the <i>Sue Davis</i> show come out of Vic
Wylie’s radio that afternoon, Joe suffered. It was
tripe. There was no spice, no spirit, no punch. Lines
and speeches that went on and on until they had
gone on for thirteen and a half minutes. Then they
stopped. Vic was right; the curtain was corny. He
shut off the radio and went home.</p>

<p class='c010'>Kate Carlin brought him a glass of hot milk.
“Throat pain much, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He shook his head. There was no pain. That was
the maddening phase.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did I imagine the show was bad to-day?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was very bad.” Talk was an effort. “They had
to build a new script in a hurry. To-morrow’ll be
better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To-morrow was no better. He sat in on the dress,
and it was torture not to be at the mike reading the
Dick Davis part. It was torture to listen to dialogue
that had become lifeless and spiritless. Vic Wylie’s
eyes seemed sunken.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Five minutes after we signed off last night,” Stella
Joyce fluttered, “Amby Carver was around wanting
to know what had happened. He knew the script had
been fluffed up with an egg-beater.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Amby’s worried about his ten per cent,” Joe whispered
bitterly. Amby, his agent, hadn’t bothered to
phone him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie, strained, came from the control-room and
drew him aside. “Kid, stay away. I know how you
feel, but worry won’t get you anything. The script’s
blue, the cast’s blue, and your face’s as long as four
Sundays. Forget radio until you clear up. Interest
yourself in something else. Read a book, steal a car,
make a mud pie. Do anything so long as it isn’t radio.
See me Saturday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Vic had said to read a book. Books flashed a picture
before Joe of his father’s business. He tried to
force his mind to dwell on how the Thomas Carlin
store could sell more books. Fifty thousand listeners!
What could you say that would make them book-hungry?
Thomas Carlin Presents To-day’s Book. Curt
Lake had been right, too. You couldn’t snip an idea
out of the air; you couldn’t deliberately dig up an
idea as you would a garden bulb. Thomas Carlin
Presents.... The effort died in failure. His mind refused
to freshen, to come alive.</p>

<p class='c010'>A mound of letters awaited him at the Everts-Hall
Agency. He signed them and rode dully out to the
Northend.</p>

<p class='c010'>That afternoon’s broadcast was worse than the
dress. The continuity of the show had been broken,
and weak, forced, hack-toiled scripts had demoralized
the cast. Stella Joyce sank with the others.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vic doesn’t want me to come to the rehearsals
until I’m better,” Joe said at supper in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Isn’t that wise?” Kate Carlin asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe!” Tom Carlin picked his words carefully. “Is
there any chance of another actor being called in for
the part?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe didn’t want to think of that.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lying in bed, wakeful, he had to think of it. He
tried to think of it coldly and calmly, as though he
weren’t thinking about Joe Carlin at all but about
somebody else. They’d have to get a juvenile for the
part. What man could play the part of a young high-school
boy? A man’s voice, deepened and matured,
would be a give-away; the mother-son illusion would
be shattered. Certainly they couldn’t find a juvenile
in this city. Amby had told him once that local radio
was strangely shy of juveniles who were tops, and he
had since found this to be true. Last season Sonny
Baker had been here and Sonny had skimmed the
cream. This season it was Joe Carlin. He’d have had
the lead in <i>Bush-League Larry</i> had the show sold.
He was playing opposite Stella Joyce in <i>Sue Davis</i>.
Who else was there?</p>

<p class='c010'>The answer was plain—nobody. Would they bring
somebody down from New York? But what juvenile,
with a chance to make the big time, would come
here to play in a five-dollar-a-day show? And again
the answer was—nobody.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe Carlin thought: “I’m in luck. They’ll have to
wait for my voice to come back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Friday’s show was so painful he could not bear to
hear it to the end.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When do you see the doctor again?” his mother
asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He was at Dr. Zinn’s door before the door was
open. He sat in a darkened room and a beam of light
illuminated his throat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Better,” the doctor pronounced cheerfully. “Much
better. Very much better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My voice isn’t any better,” Joe whispered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sometimes these attacks prove stubborn. Once
the voice begins to regain its strength improvement
is rapid. You must give it time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How much time?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Another week—perhaps ten days. Nature does her
own healing; she can’t be rushed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ten more days meant ten more scripts in which
Curt Lake held the broken threads of a show and
tried to patch with the wrong colors.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can’t you rush this a little, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, my boy, you mustn’t be impatient,” the
doctor answered tolerantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe wondered what Dr. Zinn would think of patience
if he were a radio actor out of a show that was
going to pieces. Vic Wylie’s office was locked. The
boy went to the Everts-Hall Agency. There were only
three letters to be signed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tony wants to see you,” the publicity department
told him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Genial Tony Vaux was no longer the hail-fellow-well-met
who boomed jovially. He was quiet and
thoughtful, almost reserved. “How’s the throat coming,
Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The He people have finally come around to it.
They want an audition Monday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t give a good show Monday, Tony. You
know what I can do when my voice is right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony scratched his chin. “The He people don’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But they won’t go on the air for another couple
of weeks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony continued to scratch his chin. “When a sponsor
buys a show, he buys what he hears. You can’t
sell him a package by telling how good it will be in
two weeks. Why isn’t it good to-day?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What time Monday, Tony? I might—” There was
no need to finish. Tony seemed to have withdrawn
into some further reserve.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll give you a call, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought: “You may have to.” When Wylie told
a man he was tops, he was tops. Where would they
find another juvenile who was tops?</p>

<p class='c010'>This time the knob on the door of Vic Wylie Productions
turned. Miss Robb’s desk was closed. The
inner office door was open and Joe heard voices.
With a shock of amazement he recognized his own
voice, Stella’s voice, Bert Farr’s voice. Recognition
widened and amazement grew. This was one of the
early scripts of the <i>Sue Davis</i> show. What—? He
walked to the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie, his chin sunk in the palm of one hand,
glumly listened to the playing of a platter. Two
minutes, three minutes passed and the script reached
its curtain. The shut-off clicked and the platter ceased
to revolve.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kid, what did the doctor say?” Wylie had not
moved.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe whispered: “A week or ten days. What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wylie insurance.” The producer was harsh. “I
can’t afford to leave myself out on a limb. Suppose
some member of the cast falls under a truck. Can I
bring in a new actor and tell him I want him to read
like So-and-so? Perhaps he’s never heard So-and-so.
I give him So-and-so. Every once in a while I cut a
platter. The cast never knows it’s being cut. When I
have to recast, the new member of the cast gets a
platter diet. Again and again, hour after hour. That’s
his part; that’s the voice the audience associates with
the part. When he goes on the air, not one in a thousand
suspects a new voice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s breathing was rapid and shallow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie brooded. “Kid, Munson’s dishing out the
ice. He says the show’s slipping. It is. It’s doing a nose
dive. Five thousand radios have tuned us out in the
last three days. When they start to yawn and tune in
another station, it’s almost time to ring down the
curtain. I don’t like to hand this to you, kid, but you
got to get it straight. Show business pays off to the winner.
You can’t have bacon and eggs without the
bacon. You can’t have a mother-and-son without the
son. Munson bought a mother-and-son show. He’s
not getting it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe stared at the platter and was cold. Tony, and
now Vic! If he lost the Dick Davis part he’d be making
the rounds again, haunting the offices of casting
directors, putting on a nice new front every morning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who are you getting, Vic?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie took his hand away from his chair. “No
Baltimore nephew, anyway,” he snarled.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was no longer cold. He had figured the set-up,
and he had figured it correctly. Vic had nobody in
mind. Tony might fish around and be content to do
the best he could with a part, but not Vic. Vic never
compromised. You were tops or you wouldn’t do.
Where was Vic going to find a juvenile he’d rate
tops? Perhaps he’d throw somebody in the part for
a week for the sake of the story, so that Munson
would have a mother-and-son show. But even a week
of that would gripe the violent, temperamental producer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Royal Street was crowded; Royal Street sparkled.
Archie Munn stood in front of the FKIP Building
talking to a tall, languid young man who wore his
clothing with a careless, studied indifference. Joe
nodded and passed, and stopped at the corner to buy
a <i>Journal</i>. He was waiting for change when Archie
overtook him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Better buy two copies, Joe. They give Lu a nice
notice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe bought a second copy and nodded back toward
the FKIP Building. “Show business?” he asked
in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A newcomer?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not exactly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t remember having seen him before. Who is
he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Archie Munn’s deep voice was level and dry.
“Sonny Baker. Amby rushed him back from the coast.
He got in this morning.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER 9</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Monday Joe Carlin kept away from the world of
radio. Sonny Baker was shooting at the Larry Logan
part he had expected to play and at the Dick Davis
part he had been playing—and he was licked. Licked
by a little bug that had invaded his throat. His voice
was still a whisper. To-day, either at Vic Wylie’s office
or at Tony Vaux’s office, he’d have felt like a Pop
Bartell, wistfully hoping for a miracle. Old Pop,
pathetically youthful and gallant, at least had something
to give a microphone. He, with his voice gone,
would have absolutely nothing. He wouldn’t even
have a front.</p>

<p class='c010'>And so Joe Carlin, who up to last week had been
an actor in the bright world of radio, raked the yard
and tried not to think that to-day Tony Vaux was
scheduled to sponsor-audition the <i>Bush-League Larry</i>
show and that this morning Vic Wylie had held another
dress of the <i>Sue Davis Against the World</i> show
at FKIP. Toward noon the telephone rang inside the
house. His hands gripped the rake. Tony had said
he’d call if— A minute passed. Joe began to rake
again.</p>

<p class='c010'>He gave up trying not to think. Why should Tony
have shied away from his offer to come in to-day unless
the Everts-Hall Agency producer had known
Sonny was on his way? Vic Wylie, brooding over a
platter, must have vetoed a suggestion that Mrs.
Munson’s Baltimore nephew step into the <i>Sue Davis</i>
cast. But Vic had not known that Sonny was back
in town. Joe was sure of that.</p>

<p class='c010'>He raked slowly. If you took your time, raking
could kill the crawling hours of fate. Thinking built
up facts, and facts fitted together like bricks in a wall.
Ambrose Carver still had Mrs. Munson’s ear. Sonny
had not been a glittering success on the coast, else
he would not have returned for a part in a show
paying twenty-five dollars a week. Playing small time
on the coast, Sonny would not have accumulated
money for a return journey across a continent. Somebody
had paid for his railroad ticket. Amby? Joe
couldn’t imagine the dapper little agent buying anybody’s
ticket. Then it must have been Mrs. Munson,
still piqued because of the failure of her nephew.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe put the rake away. Every leaf was garnered
and burned, and raking had become a fiction. When
he came into the house, his mother was upstairs. He
dialed the radio, brought in FKIP, and left the station
on.</p>

<p class='c010'>By and by Vic Wylie’s four o’clock show went on
and went off. A watch company gave a spot announcement
of the time, and a commentator gave
five minutes of news flashes from around the world.
A quartet sang. They’d be off in ten minutes. They
were off.</p>

<p class='c010'>A voice broke into the silence of the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-day Munson brings you a story from the pen
of Curt Lake, <i>Sue Davis Against the World</i>—” The
Munson plug followed—a Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday sale of coats on the third floor. Then
came that momentary pause that always comes between
the commercial plug and the show itself. Joe’s
mouth was dry. He had heard no sound on the stairs,
yet he knew his mother sat behind him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And now,” came an announcer’s crisp voice, “what
has become of Dick Davis? Six days ago, with slender
family finances almost exhausted, he left home to
get to Fairfield as best he could, taking with him
his only possession of possible value, an album containing
a modest collection of stamps. For six days
Sue Davis has anxiously awaited her son’s return. Is
he all right? Has he reached Fairchild? Have the
stamps which he has been patiently soaking from
discarded envelops for several years any real value?
Perhaps we are to learn, for the scene is the small
office of Landis, the Stamp Man. The door opens
and a boy enters. Listen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Voices came out of the speaker, and the first voice
was boyish, and troubled and hesitant:</p>

<p class='c014'>Are you Mr. Landis?</p>

<p class='c017'>Hello, son. Yes; I’m Mr. Landis. Close the
door, please. You look as though you’ve been
traveling.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have. I’m Dick Davis. I come from Maple
Grove.</p>

<p class='c017'>That’s a good piece back in the mountains,
isn’t it?</p>

<p class='c017'>Yes, sir. I—I thought—Do you buy stamps?</p>

<p class='c013'>Something that was like ice prickled and crawled
on Joe’s scalp. A miracle was happening. Vic Wylie
had prepared him for the miracle, and yet he had not
expected so stupendous a miracle. One of the voices
coming out the speaker was his. Not his exactly—but
his.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frozen, he listened. Curt Lake had written a good
script. A show that was dying on its feet was suddenly
alive and glowing. The story unfolded with a
wealth of sympathetic feeling—a boy’s suspense as
pages of the album were turned, the sudden finding
of some stamps of value, an offer at last of thirty-five
dollars. With the business completed, the stamp man
was ready to relax, and grow mellow, and talk shop.
But the boy, a fortune in his pocket, was on fire to
be away. His voice throbbed through the speaker:</p>

<p class='c014'>I can’t stay, Mr. Landis. Maybe I’ll come
back some day and we can have a long talk.
I can’t talk now. I—I want to get home.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the curtain line—a good curtain line. A curtain
line for a good show. Joe’s hand, leaden, turned
off the radio.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who was it?” Kate Carlin asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sonny.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A little of his own voice came through.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did Vic Wylie do it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Platters. He must have had Sonny listening to
platters of the show for hours. Any good actor can
mimic a voice if he hears it often enough and practises
an imitation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think he played the part well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The admission was hard to make. “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman stood up abruptly. “I like you better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re swell,” Joe whispered huskily. Was his
reading better or was his mother voicing blind Carlin
loyalty? Munson would like Sonny, but how about
Vic Wylie? How about Tony Vaux? If the <i>Larry</i>
show had not been auditioned to-day for the He
people, if something had gone sour and put the audition
off, his voice might be right for the postponed
audition. At least, he wouldn’t have to rake a yard
and let Sonny walk off with the plum.</p>

<p class='c010'>He reached for the telephone. “Joe Carlin, Tony,”
he whispered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony boomed jovially. “Hello, Joe. How are you?
Glad to hear from you. You’re beginning to sound
like yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony, Joe thought with cynical understanding, was
putting on his “Howdy, folks” act. To-day it seemed
like the artificial sweetness on a doctor’s bitter pill.
“Did you audition to-day?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m sorry I couldn’t have you, Joe.” Tony sounded
as though his heart was torn. “If there was a chance
to postpone— But you know how it is, Joe. When a
sponsor’s ripe on the tree, that’s the day you have
to pick him. We couldn’t get the spot we wanted at
FKIP.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So the show had been sold!</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll go on at FFOM. I surely wanted you, Joe.
Not that Sonny didn’t give me a good show. Smooth
as oil. But ... well, you seem to work better with
Pop Bartell. If anything turns up—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure,” said Joe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Kate Carlin was back in the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ve lost that show, too,” Joe said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh!” The word held distress.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Something’s bound to turn up; shows keep coming
along.” But Joe didn’t try to tell himself that if you
were good enough for Wylie, you were good enough
for any of them. He had been good enough for
Wylie—and he was out. And shows didn’t keep coming
along this late in the season.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin came home an hour earlier than usual.
Coming down the stairs, Joe heard low-voiced talk in
the kitchen. Conversation died away with his appearance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Didn’t the show seem to have more body to-day?”
his father asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Evidently there was to be no telling him the show
had been bad. He was grateful for that. What good
was family loyalty that blindly deceived itself?</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no talk of <i>Sue Davis</i> at the evening
meal. Tom Carlin felt through his pockets.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Care to walk to the corner, Joe? I’m out of
tobacco.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought: “He wants to talk to me alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You told Mother something would turn up,” his
father said as soon as they reached the street. “I’ve
been trying to figure out if you really meant that.
Men usually try to shield the women at home from
their business worries. Was what happened to-day a
situation that turns up habitually in radio or was
it serious?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe did not hesitate. “It was serious.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Munson didn’t want you originally and has resented
you. Is that what you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think you’re out of the show permanently?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know. I might never have had the part
if Sonny Baker had been in town last month.” He had
never before talked to his father so freely and so
easily, man to man, without restraint.</p>

<p class='c010'>The owner of the neighborhood store greeted
them. “Glad to hear you back on the air, Joe. You
acted good—better than I ever heard you before.
Nothing like a little vacation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing,” Tom Carlin said dryly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe winced.</p>

<p class='c010'>Walking home, Tom Carlin said: “That hurt, Joe,
didn’t it? I was working at your age in a country
store for two dollars a week. There was another merchant
in town with a more imposing store, and I expected
to go to work for him the next month for
two-fifty a week. In those days a great many persons
bought bean coffee and ground it at home. A customer
came in for a coffee-mill. I took a heavy mill
down from the shelf and dropped it. It smashed, and
the handle flew up and knocked off the customer’s
hat. He left in a rage. My employer fired me. The
other merchant decided he didn’t want a clumsy lout
for a clerk. I was out of the job I was holding and
out of the job I had expected to hold. I thought it
might help if I told you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It seemed incredible that the man who owned one
of the brightest stores in the city should have lost two
jobs in one day. Two jobs—two parts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It does help,” Joe said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly he knew that to-morrow he’d go downtown.
Downtown was his world with or without
a voice, with or without a part. But he wouldn’t go
downtown with a swaggering, theatrical front. Front
was a fake.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moving through the mid-morning traffic of narrow
Royal Street, Joe heard the familiar blare of
FKIP’s speaker, broadcasting a tune that, having
leaped into the Hit Parade, would be murdered by
radio bands before the week was out. FKIP piled on
the program in its usual pattern of gaudy layers. One
brassy layer that went out into the street, a tinny,
metallic layer for the hall, a softer layer for the elevator.
Joe sighed. It was raucous and overdone, but
he’d missed it. The operator started to close the door,
craned his neck to look out into the hall, and held
the door open. Stella Joyce stepped into the car.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe!” Her hands went out to him impulsively. “Say
something.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe spoke a few words from an old <i>Sue Davis</i>
script: “Mother, you must listen—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your voice is stronger.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A little.” He had noticed the change that morning.
Six days too late! He said: “You had a good show
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You should have been around last night,” said
Stella, and cast up her eyes. “Sonny had his teeth in
the part and decided to do a little ad libbing. You’ve
seen Vic in his production rages, but have you ever
seen him in one of his subtle moods? He’s an artist.
For one hour he had Sonny on a page of script following
each line the way a child reads and stammers
through a primer. He made Sonny spell every word;
then he made him read every word very slowly. ‘So
you can actually read,’ Vic said with an air of surprise.
‘I was beginning to have my doubts. Now let
me hear you read the part the way it was written.’
After that Sonny read the part—the way Curt Lake
wrote it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s lips twitched. The elevator let them out into
the reception-room and they sat together on one
of the blue leather settees.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think Vic’s troubles with Sonny are over,”
Stella said thoughtfully. “Sonny’s had a touch of the
coast; he may have picked up some of the Hollywood
technic. When you get in a jam, yell for your
agent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe couldn’t picture little, dapper Amby Carver
bearding Vic Wylie. “Does Sonny make a steady
practice of ad libbing?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s his specialty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But doesn’t that ball up the cues?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sonny’s only interested in building up his own
part and stealing the show. He’s clever. Very often
he gets away with it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was in <i>City Boy</i> last season. What happened
there?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ask the cast that played with him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean he’s permitted to mangle the lines?
Who produced that show?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella said: “Tony Vaux.” She stood up. “Coming
in?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe hesitated. “I’m not in the cast now. Wylie
may not want—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t be foolish,” the actress said and took his
arm.</p>

<p class='c010'>Walking into Studio B was like coming home after
a long absence. Bert Farr, reading the radio department
of the <i>Journal</i>, tossed the paper away. “We are
now cursed,” he said gloomily, “with a genius in the
cast.” He might be out of the show, Joe thought,
but these people were his friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beside him Stella said in sharp undertone, “I
thought so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby Carver and the tall, pale youth Joe had seen
talking to Archie Munn outside the FKIP building
were in the studio.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vic around yet?” Amby asked briskly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.” Bert Farr was short.</p>

<p class='c010'>Little Amby Carver had steered a client into a
sponsored show; little Amby was beginning to count
himself a somebody in show business. The rebuff
left him unruffled. He saw Joe and instantly the cane
waggled with pointed carelessness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hello, Joe. Throat better? Too bad you weren’t
around yesterday; I might have been able to throw
something your way. Why not drop in some morning?
I can’t promise to do anything for you, but
there may be a part.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s neck burned. Amby’s front of superiority and
condescension was something he couldn’t take. He
asked flatly: “Are you still in the same rat-hole?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bert Farr chuckled.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby flushed. His hand touched the tracing of
mustache. “Sour, Joe?” he asked softly. “Does that
get you anything? Sonny, this is Joe Carlin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who?” Sonny asked languidly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Carlin? You remember. Joe Carlin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh!” Sonny held out a hand that was limp and
moist. “Didn’t they try you out in my part?”</p>

<p class='c010'>My part! “No,” said Joe. “I played it.” He didn’t
like this Sonny Baker.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really?” Sonny’s drawl was insolent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sonny!” Amby chided in sly malice. “Is that nice?
I ask you. Must you forget Joe’s only a high-school
amateur?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe remembered the day he had found Amby out
and had scorned him, and how Wylie had said: “Kid,
he’ll never forgive you.” But he was too young, too
raw and inexperienced, to cope with this acid baiting.</p>

<p class='c010'>A light switched on in the control-room. The hollow
eyes of Vic Wylie stared out at them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is a rehearsal,” the producer snapped through
the two-way mike. “Those not connected with the
show will leave the studio.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe walked toward the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not you, kid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Fire ran through Joe. If he was still connected with
the show ... Sonny Baker, languidly amused, was
watching him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look here, Wylie,” dapper Ambrose Carver cried
angrily, “if you think—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The light in the control-room snapped off. Vic
Wylie came out to the studio, hollow-eyed and tired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where’s your spot in this show. Carver?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m Sonny’s agent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That doesn’t mean a thing to me. I’m not dealing
with agents on this show.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll deal with me,” Amby sputtered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Out of the way.” Wylie moved the microphone.
It didn’t need moving, but moving it gave him the
opportunity to brush the agent aside.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby was pushed back on his heels. “You can’t
do this to me. You can’t hound Sonny. He’s an artist.
He’s too big to be told he’s a Vic Wylie rubber stamp.
He’s no high-school—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie swung about with a snarl. “Get out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The impact of the two words jolted the little agent
as though they were blows.</p>

<p class='c010'>The scrap of ridiculous mustache quivered. “Now,
now, Vic—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get out. If I have to tell you again, you’ll take
your star out with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby Carver cleared his throat. Whatever he
meant to say died under the producer’s glare.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is no time to upset the cast,” Amby said
pompously. “I’ll take this up with you later.” The
usually jaunty cane trailed as he made his exit with
an attempt at frigid dignity. Sonny languidly polished
the nails of one hand against the palm of the other
and hummed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie said: “Five minutes to clear out the bad
smell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought: “Vic wants the tension to ease before
he puts on the dress.” The sound-effects engineer
superintended the arrival of a sound-effect door, and
the boy wondered if Wylie would blow up because
the property was late. The cast said very little. Sonny,
still humming, opened and closed the portable door
several times.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why don’t you buy yourself a rattle?” the engineer
asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sonny gave him a slant-eyed glance, opened and
closed the door again, ran his hands into his trouser
pockets, and unconcernedly strolled to the control-room
and back.</p>

<p class='c010'>The five minutes were up. Instead of directing
the dress from the control-room, Wylie straddled
a chair and motioned for the cast to begin. Bert Farr
handed Joe a script.</p>

<p class='c010'>The show opened with a lonely, worried Sue Davis
still awaiting the return of her son. Then came a
knock on the door and the appearance of Israel Tice,
the local skinflint who wanted to get his hands on this
piece of mountain property that would some day
have value. Tice, played by Bert Farr, knew of Sue’s
desperate necessity. He renewed his offer for the
property, reluctantly edging up the price. Sue, for
the first time, wavered. Their credit at the general
store was stopped, and there seemed so little hope
that Dick’s trip to sell his stamps would be successful.</p>

<p class='c010'>An absorbed Joe Carlin followed the script:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Tice</span>: I ain’t seen your boy, Dick, lately.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sue</span>: No.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Tice</span>: Been away-like?</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sue</span>: For a while.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Tice</span>: You ain’t communicative, widder, are
you? He ain’t trying to raise some money?</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sue</span> (alarmed): Who told you that?</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Tice</span> (with satisfaction): Reckon I don’t
need telling. It ain’t fitting for a boy to be out
of school because his mother’s stubborn ’bout
a piece of wuthless land. Suppose something’s
gone and happened to Dick?</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sue</span>: Please!</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Tice</span>: Widder, with some money handy
there’d be no call for Dick to be away. You
think of that for a while. Then you do some
thinking on this paper—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sound—Crinkle of paper</span></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sue</span>: What is that?</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Tice</span>: A paper, all legal, to sell for one
thousand dollars. You put your name down here—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sue</span>: No. I won’t.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Tice</span>: And this other paper, widder, is a
check for one hundred dollars for down payment.
Cash money. Cash money so a boy
stays home where he belongs. One hundred
dollars right in your hand and no call to be
fretting about where a boy is and what mischief’s
a-brewing. You think on it hard and
I’ll be back in an hour.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sound—Footsteps crossing floor and
door closing</span></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sue</span>: What shall I do? What shall I do?</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dick</span> (off mike): Mother!</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sue</span> (overjoyed): It’s Dick. He’s home.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dick</span> (coming on mike): Mother, wait—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sound—Door bursts open</span></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dick</span> (full mike): Wait until you hear—What’s
that paper?</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sue</span>: Mr. Tice left it—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dick</span>: Tice? What’s that other paper? A
check from Tice? You didn’t—Oh!</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sound—Door closes</span></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Curtain</span></p>

<p class='c013'>Motionless, silent, Vic Wylie had sat through the
dress. He lifted his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No. You’re expecting a bomb-shell and all you
get is a bubble. The curtain’s a phony.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The studio was silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>What was it, Joe wondered, that left that sensation
of hollowness? There should have been drama. Sue’s
distress, Dick’s return—and a door closed. That was
all—a door closed. He brought his hands together
with a clap.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Got something, kid?” Wylie’s eyes, despite their
weariness, burned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What happens?” Joe asked. “A door shuts. You
don’t know whether Dick’s simply shut the door or
whether he’s walked out. It’s just a sound. The show’s
too human for that. It must end on a human note.
The door’s an anti-climax. Dick says: ‘A check from
Tice? You didn’t—’ That’s where the door should
close, slowly, as though all the pep’s been knocked
out of him. Then he says that one word. ‘Oh!’ Isn’t
that your curtain?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Once before, on the day he had suggested a change
in Pop Bartell’s reading in the <i>Bush-League Larry</i>
show, the producer had studied him with that strange
intentness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should have seen it, kid. Tired. We’ll see how
it goes. Got your script marked? Stella. Take it from
‘Mr. Tice left.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>They read again:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Sue</span>: Mr. Tice left it—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dick</span>: Tice? What’s that other paper? A
check? A check from Tice? You didn’t—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sound—Door closes</span></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dick</span>: Oh!</p>

<p class='c013'>“That does it,” Vic Wylie said at last. “The real
McCoy. It stands.” He picked up his brief-case and
left them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sonny draped a top-coat across his arm. “First an
actor and now a producer. You should try script-writing,
Carlin.” He sauntered toward the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He makes me furious,” Stella snapped. Joe had
never before seen her ruffled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the movies,” Bert Farr said, “they tried to hog
the camera. On the stage they have a trick of spoiling
another actor’s big scenes by moving about and distracting
the audience. How long will Vic put up
with him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella looked at Joe. “I want to be around the
day Vic lets down his hair.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clear understanding came to Joe. Stella had suspected
that Amby, flushed with a new importance,
would not be able to resist the temptation to impress
that importance on Vic Wylie; Stella had urged him
into the studio so that Wylie would make a fresh
mental comparison.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thanks, Stella,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella gave a faint smile. “Not that Vic needed
the lesson,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>A new Joe Carlin walked out of FKIP, the old
high-spirited lilt back in his stride. Amby Carver
sputtered angrily in Royal Street and Sonny Baker
listened with languid amusement. Joe’s dislike of
Sonny increased. Amby had brought Sonny back from
the coast and had put him in a part; the actor should
at least have remembered that. But Sonny, Joe saw
in a flash of wisdom, would be a taker and never a
giver, egotistical and selfish, and contemptuous even
of his friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>One thought ran happily through the boy’s mind:
Vic, ousting Amby as having nothing to do with the
show, had told him to stay. Sonny taking liberties
with script, and Amby trying to get tough! His voice
couldn’t have begun to come back at a better time.
All his worries of the past week had been unnecessary
worries. Well, he’d be smart. He’d stay away and,
along toward the end of the week, call Vic and tell
him he was all right. After that, he might have another
few days to wait. Waiting, when you waited
in sick uncertainty, was hard; but those last few days
of waiting would be comparatively easy. He’d be on
his way back.</p>

<p class='c010'>The heady pulse of show business once more
throbbed in his blood. Sentiment took him back
to the restaurant off Royal Street where Vic had
once rehearsed him across a table. He had hoped
to have the table to himself, but a girl sat where
Wylie had sat. Disappointed, he walked past the
table. Then the girl turned her head and he recognized
Miss Robb.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vic Wylie’s stenographer said in a rush of words:
“When did you get back in circulation, Joe? Were
you at FKIP? Did you hear Lucille Borden goes on
the air next Monday? The show’s a comedy—<i>Never
Tell a Woman</i>. I didn’t know she could play comedy.
Did you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl was plainly flustered. Was she afraid he’d
begin to ask her questions about the <i>Sue Davis</i> show,
about Sonny Baker, about the rehearsals? He had,
Joe reflected, learned all he needed to know this
morning.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Robb rattled on: “I saw a movie last night,
Joe. <i>Guns Along the Rio.</i>”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s mind was elsewhere. “That’s an old picture,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not so very old. Two or three months ago Cecil
de Mille gave it on the air. I thought I’d like to see
the picture if it ever was revived. Last night I discovered
it was showing at a neighborhood playhouse.
What’s the matter, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>His inattention was gone. “You mean you heard
a short radio version and then wanted to see the
complete picture?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, yes. I suppose what I heard whetted my
appetite for more. Is that so strange?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose not,” Joe said slowly. “Does it happen
often?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To me? It’s happened several times. It’s happened
to my sister. It’s happened to people I know. You
do think it’s strange, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Strange isn’t the word,” said Joe. He shook off a
hovering waitress. “No dessert; I’m in a hurry.” Miss
Robb’s face showed relief as he stood up to go. He
shook that off, too. Strangeness lay in the fact that
this had been in front of him all the time and that
he hadn’t seen it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Royal Street swallowed him and hurried him along
with the crowd. Thomas Carlin Presents To-day’s
Book! He’d always felt there was a way for his father
to put on a broadcast and sell books. The movies
did a selling stunt every day. COMING ATTRACTIONS,
and then half a dozen shots from next week’s
picture. The trick was to dramatize a scene from a
book and make people want to read the whole book.
Vic probably wouldn’t use him until next Monday’s
show. He had almost a whole week.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Thomas Carlin store was busy with men and
women from the tall office buildings, shopping during
the lunch hour. One of the clerks raised a cupped
hand to his lips and Joe shook his head. No; he
wasn’t back on the air. His father was out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want a book,” he said eagerly to Mr. Fairchild,
his father’s assistant. “I don’t care whether it’s an
old book or a new book, but it must be a good book
with lots of action.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The jitterbug influence,” Mr. Fairchild smiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s hands made an impatient gesture. “Life.
Something you can feel. The McCoy.” Vic Wylie
might have been speaking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Something—dramatic?” the man asked with a
shrewd glance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe went blank. He didn’t want to say anything
about this until he saw how it worked out. Mr. Fairchild
took a book down from a shelf; the telephone
rang, and he had to go to the office. Joe made his
escape, winking at the clerks as he passed out toward
the street.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next three days were busy days. He was making
a show. A book to read and one particular scene
to be picked for dramatization. What scene? Chapter
Eight offered a scene tense and climactic. But the
action called for four characters. Four were too
many—a twenty-dollar cast. There was a scene in
Chapter Two between the lead and the heavy. Was
it strong enough? He walked the floor of his room,
reading the passage aloud. Perhaps that run in Chapter
Nine with three characters.... Sometimes his
brain grew bewildered. He thought of Curt Lake
sweating, and swearing, and knocking out a new
script under pressure the day his throat had gone
bad.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were interruptions—lunch, the <i>Sue Davis</i>
broadcast, the family dinner in the evening. But even
as he described Sonny Baker or told of Amby Carver’s
rout, his mind was upstairs with the book. It would
have to be the scene from Chapter Two.</p>

<p class='c010'>He worked behind the closed door of his room
and rattled a portable typewriter. He knew the
mechanics of writing script, and the dialogue of the
scene was before him on the printed pages. The first
two sheets of script spun out of the typewriter. Then
Joe ran into a passage in the book that analyzed the
thought passing through a character’s mind. How did
you get a character’s thoughts into a script? Radio
had to be dialogue. He wrote, and tore up what he
had written, and wrote again. He gave up in despair
and fooled with a cross-word puzzle. He pushed that
aside and went back to writing. Nothing would jell.
He tried talking the scene aloud.</p>

<p class='c010'>Kate Carlin cried: “Joe, are you all right?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Sure, he was all right. He was swell. Curt Lake
could have script-writing—he wanted no part of such
a headache. Why couldn’t he find the words? It
shouldn’t be so hard to express a thought. Just about
two sentences. Inspiration came to him from whatever
void it is that gives birth to inspiration. He went
back to the typewriter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thursday night he finished the script in an exultation
of authorship. Nine pages—that’s how long a
Curt Lake script ran for a fifteen-minute show. Now
he had to have a signature that would mark the start
of every program, and he had to have an opening
plug and a closing plug.</p>

<p class='c010'>A rough idea for a distinctive signature came Friday
morning. He put it down:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Voice</span>: I am ink, and paper, and the thoughts of men.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sound—Faint rumble of printing press</span></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Voice</span>: I am the printed word.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sound</span> (full mike)—<span class='sc'>Rumble of printing press</span></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Voice</span>: I am BOOKS.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sound—Press rumble fades to—</span></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Announcer</span>: Thomas Carlin presents to-day’s book—</p>

<p class='c013'>Absorbed, he worked on the plugs. He came to the close:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Life breathes in the printed word.</div>
      <div class='line'>Read books and live with life.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He told himself that he had something.</p>

<p class='c010'>In imagination he heard an announcer’s voice
speaking the lines into a mike. Boy, those lines were
good. He had something there. The fascination of
creation warmed him. This was show business; this
was radio. But it was also something else he did not
suspect.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was <i>Thomas Carlin Presents</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>He read over what he had written. He read it over
a second time and a frown pinched his forehead.
The plugs didn’t seem to have all the zip he had
thought was there. The feeling grew on him that he
hadn’t quite caught the boat. Probably, with a little
tinkering here and there.... He put the script in
a small upper drawer of his desk where he kept razor
blades, cuff links, tie clasps, odds and ends. He
wouldn’t hand his father this show until he had
licked it into shape. It had to be right. If the plugs
proved too much for him, if he couldn’t make them
right, he’d take them to Vic.</p>

<p class='c010'>Instantly his thoughts were back with the <i>Sue
Davis</i> show. This was Friday, about time for Vic to
give the word. On the chance that he might catch
the producer he called his office.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s not here, Joe,” Miss Robb said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell him my voice is all right, will you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why—yes. I’ll tell him, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought: “The call ought to come to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no call the next day. And the telephone
bell was silent all through the long, dragging hours
of Sunday.</p>

<p class='c010'>Premonition whispered, and the long knife of radio
uncertainty touched him once more. Vic might be
tied up. He knew this wasn’t so. The Monday show
had to be rehearsed Sunday afternoon or Sunday
night. When had Vic ever been so busy that a show
went neglected? Perhaps he should have spent the
week downtown and not have buried himself in a
dramatization. But this wasn’t a case where he had
to visit a station and keep himself fresh in a casting
director’s memory. This was a Wylie show.</p>

<p class='c010'>Monday morning the telephone rang. He was halfway
down the stairs before his mother could call:
“For you, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella’s voice fluttered. “Lu’s show goes on at four.
Are you picking it up?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wouldn’t miss it,” Joe told her. His heart was
lead.</p>

<p class='c010'>“None of us will be able to hear it. Her show goes
off fifteen minutes before we go on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Leave it to me,” said Joe, and hung up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Was that Mr. Wylie’s office?” Kate Carlin asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; Stella Joyce. She asked me to listen to Lucille
Borden.” He was silent. “I’ll pick it up at Vic’s.” Now
that he was ready to resume his part, he couldn’t
haunt Studio B. But Stella would want a report on
Lucille. He’d have a legitimate reason for waiting
until the cast came in from rehearsal. If Vic had anything
to tell him, Vic could tell him then.</p>

<p class='c010'>An afternoon romance serial was coming to the
inner room when he reached Wylie’s office.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s the station,” Miss Robb said. “Miss
Borden’s show is next.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe sat in Vic Wylie’s chair. Presently a mellow
gong announced the station and the interval between
programs. The click of Miss Robb’s typewriter
ceased.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lucille Borden’s voice, clipped, a little hard with
a familiar hardness, went through him. The voice
seemed strangely enriched with a new, deeper quality.
It was impish, provocative, casually gay, and
touched with unexpected moments of tears and of
laughter. Joe found himself chuckling. Abruptly Lu
put a yearning tenderness into a passage that caught
his breath. And then his head was back and he was
laughing as she gave drawling drollery to another
line.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lucille Borden’s premier was over. Joe knew she
had scored a smash hit. Miss Robb dabbed at her
eyes with a handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t help it, Joe. She was so wonderful.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe had to clear his throat of emotion. “She was
great.” He was thinking of the day he had hurried
to a Munson hosiery counter to tell a defeated actress
that her chance had come, and of the way her hands
had gripped the counter. The ups and downs of show
business!</p>

<p class='c010'>At 4:30 he tuned in the <i>Sue Davis</i> show. Any program
coming on after Lucille’s triumph would have
seemed flat; Lucille had fired him. He was nervous
and restless, eager to return to the cast. He roamed
out to Miss Robb’s desk.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll be glad,” he said, “to get back on the air.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl, typing faster, did not answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vic may give me the word to-day,” he added.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Robb slipped a letter from the carriage of the
machine and carried a carbon to the file. The cabinet
drawer held hundreds of yellow carbons. She placed
the copy in its alphabetical compartment and did
not speak.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe went back to Wylie’s chair. The inner room
throbbed with memories—memories of his first days
with Vic, of the hard grind of rehearsals, of the thrill
of his first days on the air. When would he go back?
Why hadn’t he played in to-day’s show?</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Robb, wearing her hat and coat, appeared in
the doorway. “If you’re staying, Joe, I won’t put the
catch on the door.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They’ll want to hear about Lucille,” said Joe.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl drew on her gloves. “Show business is
tough,” she said impulsively, and was gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Daylight faded. Had she been trying to tell him
something? Joe thought of the crowded carbons in
the filing cabinet. Sonny Baker playing fast and loose
with a script, little Amby Carver fussing impotently
in Studio B—these happenings were more or less
public. And he had thought them important. The
real story might lie in letters locked away in the
file. Letters that Wylie had received; letters he had
written. Office secrets. But Miss Robb knew those
secrets. He remembered her agitation the day he had
met her at the restaurant, and to-day she had blurted
out that show business was tough. Nobody had to
tell him that. He knew it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The inner room darkened and he turned on a light.
Did Miss Robb know why he hadn’t gone back to
the cast? Wylie had had knowledge since Friday
that he had recovered.</p>

<p class='c010'>The door from the hall opened and closed. Sonny
Baker strolled into the inner room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Around again, Carlin?” he asked. His eyes reflected
a sleepy, mocking amusement. He picked up
a magazine and lolled on the settee.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella Joyce and Bert Farr came in together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me everything,” Stella said eagerly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s description of Lucille was a rhapsody. Stella
wrote a telegram of congratulation. She read them
the telegram and the list of signatures—Vic Wylie,
Stella Joyce, Bert Farr, Joe Carlin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Robb will want to be in that,” said Joe. “Why
not Archie Munn? What’s become of him? I haven’t
seen him in two weeks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Stella said slowly: “You knew he was offered a
selling job? He took it. He had to. He couldn’t live
on bit parts and a few funerals.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’ll be back,” Joe predicted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m not so sure,” Stella said slowly. “There’s a
limit.” She held the telegram and looked toward
the settee. “Want your name on this, Sonny?”</p>

<p class='c010'>One of Sonny’s eyebrows lifted blandly. “I didn’t
hear the performance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why don’t you get wise to yourself?” Stella
snapped. “Lu was always good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not bad,” Sonny murmured languidly, and returned
to the magazine.</p>

<p class='c010'>A door slammed, and Vic Wylie was upon them.
The producer’s hat was dented, his top-coat collar
was half up and half down, the brief-case, closed
by a single strap and gaping at one end, swung past
his knee. He dumped the brief-case on the desk.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You gave me a lousy show to-day,” he snarled at
the cast. “Dish-water! Hello, kid. How was she?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never heard anything better,” said Joe. He spoke
slowly and distinctly so that Wylie could get the full,
strong timbre of his voice. Of course, Vic couldn’t
very well talk up in front of Sonny. But he could
say: “Come out here a minute, kid,” and tell him
where he stood.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie’s tired face cracked into a smile. “A grand
gal, Lu; one of the best. Give her a part that fits her
and she’s tops. What did she do with the comedy
shots?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She put them over beautifully.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I always figured she’d be tops on smooth comedy.”
Wylie opened the brief-case. “Let’s get going.” He
distributed to-morrow’s show—a script to Stella, a
script to Bert, a script to Sonny....</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe walked out.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was bitter. Archie Munn had advised him in
the early days to stick to Vic, had said that Vic took
care of his people. Well, he’d called himself one of
Vic Wylie’s people. He’d auditioned the <i>Sue Davis</i>
show; he’d originated the Dick Davis role. Vic had
told him he was still in the show. He pushed through
the crowd standing in the street outside FKIP and
was deaf to the news broadcast coming from the
speaker. Had Wylie kept him in Studio B as a piece
of scenery, a prop threat to Sonny Baker that Sonny
had better be good? Was that what Miss Robb knew
and was afraid she might reveal? He said in growing
bitterness: “Show business!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He ate a belated, warmed-over dinner in the Carlin
kitchen. His father sat across the table.</p>

<p class='c010'>“See Wylie to-day, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe nodded. “I don’t know any more than I did
yesterday. Sonny’s playing the show to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you any plans?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir.” But Joe did have plans. He’d lay siege
to casting directors’ offices until he found a part.
Did Vic think radio began and ended in the office
of Vic Wylie Productions? When Vic wanted him
again, Vic could send for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next day Joe Carlin once more started to make
the rounds.</p>

<p class='c010'>He told himself: “I’ve been in a successful show;
they know me now.” But making the rounds didn’t
have the hopeful outlook it had worn last night. The
bread-and-butter hunt depressed him. He had been
all through this before; he was back where he had
started.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now that he was at liberty, no actor, beginning
to look a little seedy, led him into a quiet nook to
negotiate a small loan. None of the show people mentioned
the <i>Sue Davis</i> show. Nothing else had
changed. There was the same sharp anxiety that
showed itself only in off-guard moments, the same
glib talk of fat parts about to turn up, the same business
of having a bright gag ready for casting directors,
the same sham front that fooled nobody. Lucille
Borden had carried a front while living on coffee
and rolls. But Stella Joyce had said there was a
limit.</p>

<p class='c010'>He made the rounds thinking about Archie Munn,
who had at last reached his limit. He made the
rounds from FKIP to FFOM to FWWO. Casting
directors were brightly glib. “Hello, Carlin; how
are you?” or “Hello, Joe; how’s the boy?” Nothing
more; nothing about parts. Casting directors’ routine
hadn’t changed, either. You might make the rounds
for weeks and for months. Playing a part in a successful
show was something that had happened yesterday.
Hadn’t Archie played in successful shows?</p>

<p class='c010'>Friday added another to the growing list of fruitless
days. Gossip was a thread running through the
stations. Practically all the September programs were
renewing their radio time, and that meant few new
shows and few new parts. Joe, coming out of FFOM,
met Pop Bartell. Pop was a gilded lily—new suit, new
coat, new hat, new shoes. Show business always
dresses when it is in the money.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe,” the veteran announced impressively, “I owe
you two dollars, and an apology for not having discharged
my obligation earlier, and a round of dinners.”
He made the paying of the debt a ceremony.
“Are you following Lucille Borden? Join me in a
cup of coffee. I am familiar with a coffee house that
does very little business at this hour. We can pick it
up there. I highly recommend the cheese cake.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The raftered ceiling of the coffee house was dark
and smoky, the paneled walls were lined with sporting
prints, the tables were bare wood, scarred and
grooved. In the dim light thrown by the Dutch lamps
Pop Bartell seemed to have torn ten years from what
the world calls age.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lucille’s performance held Joe spellbound.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Brilliant,” Pop said softly, “truly brilliant.
A remarkable characterization. I salute her. Have you
heard my show, Joe?”</p>

<div id='i225'  class='figcenter id010'>
<img src='images/img-225.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Lucille’s performance held Joe spellbound. “Brilliant,” Pop said softly. “I salute her.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Joe flushed. “I’m sorry, Mr. Bartell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I understand.” A hand patted the boy’s shoulder.
“From the experiences of thirty years of wisdom,
permit me to cull you wisdom. When the bad breaks
come, never lose your front.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You never lost yours, Mr. Bartell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Had I lost that, Joe,” the old man said gravely,
“I’d have lost everything. Are you remaining for the
<i>Sue Davis</i> show?” Slim and straight, he strode toward
the street. And in that moment Joe Carlin knew why
front, for all its hollowness and sham, meant so much
to show people. It was the hard stiffener when an
actor’s precarious world was shaken; it was sanctuary
and armor.</p>

<p class='c010'>He ordered more coffee. “Will you please get
FKIP?”</p>

<p class='c010'>To-day the <i>Sue Davis</i> show rose to tense drama.
The money Dick Davis brought home after selling
his stamps was almost gone; without warning, tight-fisted
Israel Tice offered $500 more for the widow’s
property than he had offered before. Sue was weary
of fighting a battle that seemed endless. Why not sell,
she asked her son, and be done with heartache? Why
not find peace? Dick wanted to hold the property,
but he saw how the struggle was aging his mother
and consented. She was to agree to the terms when
Tice stopped in that evening. Dick, who did not
want to be present at the meeting, went off into the
mountains to search for wild grapes. He came upon a
picnic party; departing, they left behind a newspaper
published that morning at the State capital. The paper
carried the story of a new super-highway and a map.
The map showed the highway following the line of
the unimproved county road that passed his mother’s
home. Their dream of a tea-room would be realized.
But Tice must have seen the story that morning; Tice
knew what the mountain might not know until to-morrow.
Dick had to get home before his mother
signed the agreement to sell. Running down the
mountainside, crashing through thickets, he reached
the house as she lifted the pen. He stuck the newspaper
under Israel Tice’s nose, and a thwarted skinflint
departed.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was hokum. Joe knew it for hokum. But it was
good hokum, and it had built up a terrific suspense.
The kind of suspense a Curt Lake script could give
a show. Or had it been Sonny Baker’s acting?</p>

<p class='c010'>Next day Joe walked Royal Street. Saturday was
a poor day to make the rounds, but when you were
desperate for a part every day counted. FKIP’s John
Dennis sat in a deserted casting office staring at the
ceiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come in, Joe. You’re just the man I’ve been thinking
about. If I call you in to audition a show that
will go on at 4:15, will you be available?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe understood. Dennis wanted to know if he was
out of the <i>Sue Davis</i> program that went on at 4:30.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What show?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Were reviving <i>Mr. America</i>. There’s a new part
being written in that should fit you like a glove. We
put the show on last March and had three sponsor
nibbles before it went off in June. This time we think
we’ll sell it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe remembered <i>Mr. America</i>. A five-a-week sustaining.
Front demanded that he tell Gillis he was
uncertain, that he might decide not to return to the
<i>Sue Davis</i> cast. Dennis would probably know he was
lying, but that was the way front was played. He
cast front aside.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know, Mr. Dennis. Right this minute, I’m
in the dark. I’ll let you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll have to know by Wednesday. Unless there’s
a switch, we’ll start to audition Thursday and cut the
platter Saturday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll know definitely by Wednesday,” said Joe. He
had vowed Vic would have to send for him. All that
was changed. He’d have to go to Vic for a showdown.</p>

<p class='c010'>Waiting for the elevator, unconsciously listening to
an FKIP loudspeaker, Joe felt that the future held a
grim, mirthless humor. If he went on the <i>Mr. America</i>
program, he’d still be in radio. He’d still be on a
five-a-week. Both shows would come out of the
same station, fifteen minutes apart. But the <i>Sue Davis</i>
sponsored show had been paying him twenty-five
dollars a week, while the unsponsored <i>Mr. America</i>
would pay him only in experience. Show business!</p>

<p class='c010'>John Dennis’ secretary came running along the
corridor. “Mr. Carlin! I wasn’t sure I could catch
you. Mr. Wylie’s office called. You’re wanted over
there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Vic Wylie had sent for him at last!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you phone back and tell them I’ll be there
within an hour?” He’d been waiting for more than a
week. Let Vic wait an hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>He ate a sandwich at Munson’s, killed time, and
finally walked into Vic Wylie Productions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I expect Mr. Wylie back in a few minutes,” Miss
Robb said.</p>

<p class='c010'>So he hadn’t kept Wylie waiting. The inner room
still held memories. Memories softened him. Why
wrap himself in cold aloofness and let Vic see he was
sore? Vic would tell him to come back to the cast
for the Monday show and he’d go on from there, forgetting
how tough the last week had been, giving
everything he had.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie arrived without the usual accompaniment
of fury and bustle. He closed the door and placed
the brief-case upon the desk with what, for him,
might pass for gentleness. He went around to his
chair and, for a moment, seemed to give himself up
to contemplation of some thought far away. He was
gaunt and disheveled, apparently a little more tired
than usual. He hadn’t shaved.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kid,” he said heavily, “I’m not up to the light
touch. I can’t spar around with this. I’ve got to give
it to you fast and quick. You’re out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The blood drained out of Joe. Never again to play
Dick Davis.... He found his voice. “I’m out for
good?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s the ticket.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?” This was some sort of wild dream or some
mad joke. Only—Vic didn’t joke about things like
this.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You heard yesterday’s show? Yesterday wrote the
answer. I like you—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s lips moved. “You can skip that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right; you shouldn’t have to be told. I’ve been
holding off. Amby Carver’s been telling things to
Munson, Munson’s been riding Everts-Hall, Everts-Hall’s
been putting pressure on me. I got it three
ways; some of it was downstage, some from the
prompter’s book, and some from the wings. I didn’t
want Sonny unless he became a must. If he starts out
again to put himself up in lights, he can ruin the
show. If he gets under my skin and I blow my top,
I ruin the show. I told you once I don’t run a friendship
club. I might have an idea that cutting your
throat would be tops as a way to enjoy an afternoon,
but if you give me a show, I’ll toss the knife out the
window. Yesterday Sonny gave me a show. He’s a
must.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He had a script.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A stage has scenery, but it’s only an empty stage
until the scenery’s set.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Disappointment made Joe hoarse. “What did
Sonny Baker do that I couldn’t have done with the
same script?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kid,” Wylie said with weary regret, “he can act.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe Carlin was stiff and numb with shock. Was
Wylie telling him at this late date that he was a flop?
After auditioning him for weeks, fighting for him
when Mrs. Munson wanted the Dick Davis part for
a nephew, giving him the part when the show finally
went on the air? Suddenly he was white with anger.
Wylie had either fooled him at the beginning or was
fooling him now. Either way, he had been betrayed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You told me I was tops.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The producer’s hands made a weary sign. “I expected
you to throw that at me, kid. I had a show
coming up; I wanted a Dick Davis; I knew exactly
how Dick Davis should sound. I couldn’t find a Dick
Davis. Then I heard you auditioning at FKIP. You
were my Dick Davis. For that part, your voice made
you tops. You were tops until Sonny came along.
When Mr. John Public turns on the radio all he gets
is voices. Voices must build up the scene, the characters,
the atmosphere in his imagination. The show
doesn’t have the help of stage settings, lights, costumes,
and make-up. You’ve got a million dollar radio
voice, but that lets you out. You can’t do much with
it. You feel, but you can’t give. It took me weeks to
get you to give me one word, ‘Mother,’ the way I
wanted it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s breath made a sound in his throat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re good, kid, but you’re not good enough.
There’ll always be somebody better. That’s the curse
of small-time radio. Thousands of kids working in
radio all over the country, wild with ambition and
dreaming of the pot of gold. They’re good, but not
good enough. You’ve got to be better than good.
Archie Munn was good; he’s out of radio. Stella’s
good; she’s working as a part-time waitress. Lucille
Borden was good, and she was selling stockings when
she got the breaks. A part came up made to order
for her just when she auditioned, or she’d still be
selling stockings. Where will you be ten years from
now? Exactly where you are to-day. You know small-time
radio; do you want that all your life? Your voice
gets you a couple of fat parts one season, and next
season you get bits. Year after year you make the
rounds. By and by John Public gets tired of your
voice, or a new voice comes along. Then where are
you? Television’s only around the corner. John Public’s
going to see the setting, the action, and characters
in costume; radio actors will really have to
act. What will you do then? If you had dynamite on
the ball I’d tell you to stick it out if you starved. You
haven’t got it, kid, and there’s no percentage in starving
for what you haven’t got. I knew a long time ago
you didn’t have the stuff, but you were the best
Dick Davis I could get. I told you when Mrs. Munson’s
nephew auditioned you’d have been out had he
been hot. I’ve never lied to you, kid. If you’d played
forty weeks in the <i>Sue Davis</i> show you’d be hooked
for life. The bug would bite so deeply there’d be no
cure. But you were only on the air a few weeks—that
shouldn’t be fatal. You can make your exit while
there’s still time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The indictment struck Joe with a paralyzing shock.
He didn’t want to believe. He couldn’t believe that
this was true.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m not getting out, Vic. I’m writing New York
for an audition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The producer brooded. “That’s up to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A producer told Ezra Stone—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know. A producer told him to go home and
forget acting. That gets a big play. But you don’t hear
a word about the hundreds of times producers tell
the same thing to kids and are right. It’s a waste of
time to try to give the low-down to a stage-struck
kid. Doesn’t he want to act? He doesn’t know the
difference between wanting to act and being able to
act.” The producer’s hand went up and ran through
his hair; the arms fell heavily. “Kid, what have I got
to say to make you believe me?” The sunken eyes
burned.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe felt the first thin edge of doubt. He fought it
off wildly. “Why should you care what I believe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kid, do you have to ask that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>A lump, quick and unbidden, formed in the boy’s
throat. “I—I know you think....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Think?” Vic Wylie cried harshly. “I don’t have to
think about show business; I know. Tough? There
isn’t any game in the world that’s tougher. I’ve seen
it around the country: stage-struck kids working in
crummy night clubs or picking up a few dollars from
movie houses that run Saturday vaudeville. I’ve seen
it at Hollywood: movie-crazy kids storming the Central
Casting Bureau because they’ve won a two-bit
beauty contest or have a straight nose. But at least,
if you work at Hollywood, you get paid. There’s no
such thing at Hollywood as a sustaining movie.
Hollywood doesn’t fatten itself on gratis talent.
Radio’s just a little tougher than any other part of
show business. Don’t you know it? Don’t you use
your eyes?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought of bread-and-butter hunters making
the rounds.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie’s sunken cheeks were pale with intensity.
“What do you think you’re going to do in New York—show
me up for a mug? I’ll tell you what’ll happen
in New York, kid. Maybe you’ll audition and a producer’ll
say: ‘Ah, a voice of great promise.’ Maybe
you’ll go back for a committee audition. Maybe the
committee hears a voice of great promise. Then
what? Do you think you’ll snatch a part like picking
an oyster from a shell? You’ll be competing with the
people who are tops. Who are you? What’ve you
done? You become a card—a Joe Carlin card. You’ll
go into a talent file. Do you know how many cards
are in the N.B.C. file at WEAF? The last time I
heard, more than two thousand. Many of them are
troupers with years of stage experience, many of
them have played big-time radio. When a producer
casts a show, those are the people he picks. He knows
what they’ll give him. Maybe a show comes up and
the producer can’t get the people he wants; they’re
tied up in other shows. Then he goes to the file.
Maybe he’s forgotten Joe Carlin—some new cards go
into that file every month. It’s a grab-bag. Figure the
chances of the Joe Carlin card coming out. If you
had great talent I’d tell you to stay with it if you were
down to your last pair of socks, if you were mooching
your meals and panhandling your friends. I’d help
you. Great talent is rare. Kid, what makes you think
you’ve got it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Looking at Wylie, intense and drawn, listening to
his impassioned voice, Joe had to believe. Wylie had
spent far more time on him than on any other member
of the cast. That now became significant. Memory
leaped at him with other scenes, all significant.
Wylie talking to Tony Vaux about his voice—only
about his voice. Wylie almost frantic because he
couldn’t put something into the word “Mother” that
the producer wanted put there. Wylie slaving over
him through the long evening rehearsals. But he had
dreamed a dream, and a dream always dies hard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vic, why did you wait so long to tell me this?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kid, I was on a spot. It didn’t take me long to
learn you didn’t have the spark. You’d never lay
them in the aisles. What could I do, toss you out?
You were the best I could get for Dick Davis. Suppose
you had no special training for a business job?
Suppose you couldn’t land a job? Suppose radio was
your only chance of nailing a dollar? Yesterday I
began to check on you. You never told me anything
about yourself. How was I to know your father
owned that Carlin store on Royal Street? What’s the
matter, doesn’t he want you there?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’d be glad to have me there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then get wise. That’s where you belong.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes, Joe thought wanly, it was hard to be
wise. The easy companionship of show people, light-hearted
despite its anxiety, the feeling that came
over him every time he walked into a station, the
hush that settled over a studio as the clock in the
control-room crept toward the opening, the thrill as
the show went on the air! He couldn’t give up all
that.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vic,” he said, “I’m sorry. I still want show business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie sat with his unshaven chin sunk down on his
chest. “All right, kid. I’ve laid it on the line to you
and I feel better. If you want show business, you
want it. The acting door’s closed. Try the window.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What window?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie said: “Production.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was startled. A producer was an obscure figure
in the background, never heard, never seen. A producer
was part of show business, but— Oh, it wasn’t
the same thing at all. He began to shake his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wylie was the old Wylie, snarling. “I thought you
wanted show business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, you don’t. You want the spotlight and the fan
mail. Look, kid.” Wylie came out of the chair and
swung the boy about by the shoulders. “As a producer,
you don’t interpret one part. You interpret all
the parts. You set the tempo. You touch the strings
and the cast vibrates. You take a script and make it
live. You make the show, molding it and shaping it.
You’re the show, all of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s lips parted. Here was Wylie’s strange power
to move him, to galvanize him. Production took on
a color of possibility. Hadn’t he been trying to do
something like this with <i>Thomas Carlin Presents</i>?</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d have to break in, Vic. Where?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Everts-Hall Agency. Tony Vaux. Tony saw
you put a finger on what was wrong with Pop Bartell
at a <i>Bush-League Larry</i> audition. You’re a possibility.
You have an instinct. You put your finger on
a bad <i>Sue Davis</i> curtain. Production’s no bed of
roses; it’s show business and all show business is
tough. But you have a whole stage to play with. A
show becomes your baby.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was no longer stiff and numb. A regret that he
would never act lingered, but Wylie had cast a new
light on production and had made it desirable and
exhilarating.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll see Tony this afternoon, Vic.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ve already talked to him. He’s out of town to-day.
You’ll be a glorified messenger-boy-office-boy-all-around-helper—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I haven’t the job yet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Didn’t I say I talked to him? You go in Monday
and hang up your hat.” Vic Wylie went back to his
chair, jerked around abruptly, and shot out a thin,
nervous hand as though it were a spear. “Do you
know what you’re going to do, kid? You’re going to
school and take a night course. Dramatics. When
summer comes and radio’s dead, you’re taking a leave
of absence. You’re going into summer stock. You’re
joining some company playing in a cowbarn—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought I was through acting.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did I say anything about acting?” Wiley rasped.
“You’re going in as assistant stage manager. Maybe
you’ll get some money and maybe you won’t. But
you’re going to study stage business. You’re going to
watch audiences and find out what makes them
laugh and what makes them cry. You’re going to be
a showman. Some day you’ll thank me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe said slowly: “I’m thanking you now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Worming through Royal Street he was feverish
with the prospect of new horizons. A whole stage to
play with. You built shows, molding them and shaping
them. The picture grew in his mind, expanded
in his excitement. If he was some day to be a full-fledged
producer, it was time he finished his first
show. It would be something to look back upon, a
milestone. All that the plugs needed was more direct
strength, the right touch. He ought to finish the
script to-night. To-morrow he’d be able to show it
to his father.</p>

<p class='c010'>Kate Carlin called from the kitchen. “Aren’t you
home early?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I smelled apple pie,” Joe said. He watched her
take the brown, fragrant pies from the oven. “I’m
through with acting.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She almost dropped a pie. “Joe!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s all right. You and Dad never really liked the
idea of my acting, anyway. I’m going into production.
I start Monday with the Everts-Hall Agency.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She followed him to the stairs. “Why, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vic Wylie advised it. I was out of the <i>Sue Davis</i>
show. He told me I was good, but that there’d always
be somebody better. He said I’d never make
big time. It was hard to take at first, but, well, Vic
makes you believe him. You know he’s shooting
straight.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He went at once to the bureau. He’d wade into
those plugs.... He took the script from the drawer,
and hard concentration gathered between his eyes.
He knew exactly how he had left the script and now
the pages were turned about, reversed. The frown
deepened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mother, were you looking over some papers in
my bureau?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t recall any papers. What drawer were they
in?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The small top drawer on the right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The only drawer I opened was the large middle
one. I put away your laun—Oh! I remember, Joe.
Dad ran out of razor blades and went to your room
for a fresh blade.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When was that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tuesday or Wednesday. Are some papers missing?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” said Joe, swallowing. “They’re here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tuesday or Wednesday—three or four days ago.
This wasn’t a finished script. It took a professional
script-writer like Curt Lake to do a finished script.
This show was a sample, an indication of what could
be done. And his father hadn’t thought the script
worth discussing.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the fine fire of eagerness went out of him. Another
egg. First he’d laid an acting egg and now a
script egg. He tossed the script back among the razor
blades and tie clasps, and closed the drawer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER 10</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Joe Carlin “hung up his hat” in the radio department
of the Everts-Hall Agency.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe,” Tony Vaux said jovially, “I hope you won’t
find the job dull. Over here we try to stay sane.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe read this as a good-natured crack at Vic Wylie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is Vic?” Tony boomed. “Still carrying fifty
pounds of steam? They tell me a Vic Wylie rehearsal’s
an endurance contest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe grinned in affectionate remembrance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder how long Vic would keep that up if he
had to pay rehearsal time?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe had an idea that Vic, with a passion for perfection,
would still seek perfection. “No producer
around here pays rehearsal time,” he pointed out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony chuckled. “Vic should be glad of that; he’d
go broke. Besides, Vic’s a free agent; we’re salaried
employees. We have just so many hours to spend on
a show. If Vic doesn’t like a show he won’t touch it;
over here, all we can do is try to steer a client away
from a bad egg. If he still wants the egg, we have to
produce it. If we were right and it turns out to be a
bad egg, he insists that it’s our fault, that we gave
him a bad show. You’ll get to know all about eggs
over here, Joe; we walk on them all day long. We
try to smooth the sponsor, we try to smooth Everts-Hall,
we try to smooth the script-writer and the cast.
Sometimes it takes some doing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The most miles to the gallon of pleasant gas,”
said Joe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony glanced at him sharply. “You might call it
that. Did you know Mrs. Munson helped Amby
Carver to hook himself a job with her husband?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did Amby get it?” This was news to Joe. “Is
that a warning?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, now, Joe.” Tony spread placating hands.
“We have to remember that he has Munson’s ear.
Temporarily, anyway. Munson doesn’t really want
him, and, some fine day, Munson’ll toss him out. But
while he’s there, he’s there. Hold down the fort and
remember your eggs. When in doubt, tread softly.
I’ll be at FKIP until eleven.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A literary agent arrived with a platter, and another
platter came by express. “The show radio’s been
waiting for,” the agent assured Joe earnestly. “Tell
Tony to move fast if he wants an option.” A boy laid
mail on Tony’s desk, and in the mail were three
scripts. The scripts were accompanied by letters;
each letter claimed that here was the show for which
radio had been panting. The platters would have to
be indexed and auditioned, the scripts would have
to be indexed and read. An Everts-Hall account executive
demanded to know when Tony would return.
Joe began to understand why the ruddy, genial producer
could give only so much time, and no more,
to a show.</p>

<p class='c010'>Curt Lake brought in a week’s run of <i>Sue Davis</i>
script.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought you gave these to Vic,” Joe said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Carbons. Reading copies. Everybody reads—agency,
sponsor, producer. Sometimes I think they
call in a traffic cop. Anybody may throw a red flag
and then you may have to rewrite. Munson never
used to bother with script, but now he has a public
relations radio counsel—Mr. Carver. When Vic goes
into rehearsal, he’s using script with a production
O.K.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you do much rewriting?” Joe was thinking of
a <i>Thomas Carlin Presents</i> script that would never
be rewritten.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some,” Curt said dryly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ten minutes later the telephone rang. “Mr. Carver,”
said the girl outside.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby had blossomed. His cane gleamed with a
brilliant polish and his spidery mustache had taken
on the elegance of waxed, pin-point tips. “Joe, my
boy, congratulations.” The little man was bursting
with effusive cordiality, but his eyes were shifty and
apprehensive. “I’m delighted. Absolutely. I had the
word a week ago you were slated to come in here
with Tony.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe took that with an inward hoot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tony and I are great pals, Joe—like that.” Two of
Amby’s fingers hooked together to indicate a close
relationship. “Did you get a boost? Amby Carver’s
telling you you did. Didn’t I bring you into radio?
Didn’t I get you your start? I went down the line,
all the way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Amby was an open book. A future producer might
some day prove valuable. But Joe had been given
his cue. In this shop you smoothed everybody.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thanks, Amby. That was nice of you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does Amby Carver ever forget a pal? Didn’t I
tell you you’d some day know you had me wrong?”
Mr. Munson’s public relations radio counsel was no
longer apprehensive. “I’ve brought back some <i>Sue
Davis</i> script,” he said pompously, “without my approval.
Get a load of how I’m changing this show, Joe.
Sue gets typhoid. She doesn’t feel so good, but she’s
around. While she’s alone and getting delirious, she
signs for Tice. She doesn’t know what she’s doing.
Will she lose the house? Suspense. Will she get better?
Big suspense. Dick has to fight Tice in court to
get the property back. More suspense. It’s colossal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where’s Dick getting the money for a lawyer?”
Joe asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s a detail for Curt to handle,” Amby said
loftily. “He writes the show. I want to see new script
by Friday.” He added, as he left: “We must have
lunch together some day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony Vaux’s voice boomed in the reception-room,
and his step volleyed in the corridor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anything stirring, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Amby Carver changing <i>Sue Davis</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony chuckled. “Yeah? Wait until Curt hears that.”
He picked the script from the desk and, as he read,
he began to choke. “Typhoid? The fat-headed lug!
Can’t you see it coming, Joe? He’ll have a doctor fall
in love with Sue.” Tony held his sides and howled.
“Typhoid! It’s a four-star final; it’s a panic. What
wouldn’t I give to show this to Curt?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Curt?” Tony pulled out a handkerchief and
mopped a face that had begun to mottle. “He’d run
out without his hat and try to pull Amby through
a key-hole. No, no, Joe. This is where we do a
smooth job with our eggs.” He called Amby at the
Munson store.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe heard the rasp of a briskly important voice:
“Good morning. This is the public-relations-radio
office. Mr. Carver speaking.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony boomed genially. “Hello, Amby. Boy, how
do you think of them? Good? It’s a natural. How <i>do</i>
you think of them? You ought to be writing script.
You come up with ideas in each hand and every
idea’s a honey. But look, Amby. Isn’t this too good to
waste? I mean, if it’s used now— Sure; that’s the
point. We should build up to it; set the stage for a
big smash. You were thinking of that? You’re absolutely
right, Amby. Your idea, then, is to put it on
ice for two or three weeks? Great. Couldn’t be better.”
Tony put down the telephone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do we do when he starts looking for
typhoid?” Joe asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In three weeks,” Tony chuckled, “he’ll think up
a new brilliant and forget this one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The account executive came back seeking data
for an Everts-Hall client, a soap manufacturer, who
might make a cautious test of radio advertising in
this area. “He doesn’t want to spend any too much,
Tony.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They never do,” Tony boomed and brought out
platters. Joe listened to show after show until it
seemed that the world must be full of unsold radio
shows.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How about a spot?” the executive asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“FKIP’s open at 4:15.” Tony brought out the
Crosley ratings and there was absorbed discussion
of the competition the 4:15 spot faced and of the
ratings of the competing shows.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe ate a hurried sandwich at a drug-store counter.
This was the part of show business hidden from
the public. Show business behind the scenes, the
inside stuff.</p>

<p class='c010'>An actress and an actor named Mander were in
the office with Tony when Joe got back. Mander told
a story and told it well. Tony threw back his head
and roared.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Folks,” he said, “here’s where I move along.” The
actress went out with him. Their voices drifted back
from the corridor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mander waited until they were gone. “Got a half-dollar
that isn’t working, Joe?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe dug into his pocket. The bread-and-butter hunt
had followed him to the Everts-Hall Agency.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dennis is making another <i>Mr. America</i> show,”
Mander said. “He’s calling me in. They expect to
sell the show.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought: “They’re always expecting to sell a
show—to-morrow.” The day ran on, and in the late
afternoon he tuned Tony’s radio for <i>Bush-League
Larry</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sonny Baker, as a brash, hot-headed young man
beginning to make his mark in professional baseball,
gave a good, clear-cut performance. But what, Joe
asked himself in dismay, had happened to Pop
Bartell? When Tony had been putting the show
together for the He people Pop had been superb—mellowly
in character. To-day he was jerky and uncertain
as though he were having trouble with his
lines. What was it, the old trouble? Was Pop still
trying to maintain a false front of youth and refusing
to wear glasses?</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony was beaming when he returned from FFOM.
<i>Bush-League Larry</i> was clicking; he’d been told the
<i>Journal</i> was giving the show a nice notice to-morrow.
Joe, ready to start for home, lingered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is this a regular stop on the rounds, Tony?” He
had never made any of the agencies a stop.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A small stop,” said Tony. “If we have a show coming
up, we become a big stop.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That 4:15 spot—Dennis is cutting a platter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s off, Joe. He’s filling with studio music.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So Mander would not be called in. Why, Joe wondered
as he walked toward the bus line, should the
thought of Mander stay with him? He’d handed out
money to show people before. And as for Pop, he
was probably all wet on that. Hadn’t Tony said the
show was clicking? Pop, reading with him, had
sounded swell; Pop coming out of a speaker sounded
corny. Perhaps there was no difference at all. Perhaps
you merely heard the same performance from
different angles.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the days passed, the range of Tony Vaux’s activities
amazed him. The booming, jovial producer
had a Thursday night quiz show, <i>Time To Remember</i>,
a Sunday night musical-variety with guest stars,
<i>Bush-League Larry</i> three times a week, and the <i>Sue
Davis</i> five-a-week which had to be watched. And
then there were agency clients who might go on the
air if they could find the right show, and clients the
agency thought should go on the air—and the spot
announcements. This week there were seventy-eight
spots. A girl sat before a radio in a small room off
Tony’s office and checked a sheet as she tuned from
station to station and caught the spots. “Worth, the
House of Watches, brings you the correct time. It
is now—” or it might be “Young’s, where your foot
always meets a friendly shoe—” The skill with which
these spots were shuffled, juggled, spaced through
the day was almost uncanny. But it all took care, and
thought, and time, which was another reason why
Tony was limited on how much he could give a
show.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How’s the job going?” Tom Carlin asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I like it,” said Joe. To-morrow they’d be playing
platters for three different clients. Tony Vaux called
it “trotting out the drama.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was mad, this business of trotting out the drama—as
mad and as unpredictable as a Vic Wylie rehearsal.
Perhaps the client wanted comedy, and you
played him every comedy platter you had. Then he
decided he didn’t want comedy after all: how about
romance and heart throb? Or perhaps you took out
a forgotten turkey that had been gathering dust for
two years, and the client became rapt. That didn’t
mean the show was sold. For every show sold you
had thirty you figured would sell, or hoped would
sell, or slowly gave up hope of selling. Sometimes a
client heard a platter and brought back officials of
his company and kept bringing them back. Finally
he’d go out shouting a rave, and you’d think the
show was a sure sell for to-morrow morning—and
that was the last you ever heard about it. And sometimes
a client heard a platter, and liked it, and
bought it. Actually bought it at once.</p>

<p class='c010'>That’s what happened with the soap manufacturer.
He heard three platters and the third was
<i>Poisoned Fangs</i>. Next day he returned with a delegation,
and the platter was played four times. The
following morning the contract was signed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe,” Tony said genially, “I was ready to ship that
platter back. We never know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nobody?” Joe demanded. Radio was a mad turmoil,
but somebody ought to know.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who?” Tony chuckled. “The boys in big time?
We guess and they guess. Amos ’n’ Andy were on
sustaining. The station decided the show wasn’t getting
a tumble and took it off. Then came a flood of
telephone calls and letters. On the strength of listener
response Amos ’n’ Andy went back and found
a sponsor. They’ve had a sponsor ever since.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Another platter came in and Joe put it away. Platters
and scripts, casts and producers, sustaining
shows and sponsored shows, the bread-and-butter
hunt—it was all mad. When a show came in to be
sold, you never knew what you’d sell. Vic Wylie,
with a live cast, had sold Munson what radio calls
“a package”—production, script, and cast. The whole
show. But on <i>Poisoned Fangs</i> the sponsor was buying
only script. Tony would select a new cast and
make his own production.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My first agency show from the beginning,” Joe
told himself, and was on fire to see production start.</p>

<p class='c010'>No announcement of a new show was made; no
hint of a new show appeared in the radio column of
the <i>Journal</i>. But almost overnight show people made
Tony’s office a big stop on the rounds.</p>

<p class='c010'>Laughter, bursts of gaiety, lightened the heavy
boom of Tony’s voice. Show people strolled in leisurely,
singly and in pairs. Nobody was in a hurry,
nobody asked about the new show, nobody spoke
about a part. This might have been John Dennis’
office at FKIP the first day Joe had made the rounds.
Bright, sparkling gags. This was a sponsored show;
this show was going to pay money. Sometimes the
laughter was a little too eager and too high.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe laughed with them. These gatherings of show
people were grand if—he tried not to look at an
actress who kept moistening her rouged lips—if you
could forget that you’d been through it, if you could
forget the courage often required to maintain a front,
if you could forget the raw anxiety behind the mask
of gay drollery. Laughter began to hurt.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mander cocked his hat to one side, did an intricate
little step, and departed alone. But at the door he
paused and, glancing back, caught Joe’s eye significantly.
Joe, exploring a pocket for a half-dollar,
joined him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mander wasn’t thinking of money. “What show is
this?” he asked hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought: “I’m a kid in this game; he doesn’t
think it necessary to front me.” He said: “Drama.
<i>Poisoned Fangs.</i> Four characters.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Any comedy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A pop-off. Comedy relief.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thanks, Joe; thanks a million.” Somebody else
was coming out and Mander went quickly toward
the elevators.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next day there was another parade of light-hearted
gaiety, a new stock of bright gags. “Did you hear
this one, Tony—” But to-day tension was tighter; it
would be tighter to-morrow and still tighter the day
after that. There would be more and more laughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Laughter, Joe thought bitterly, was tragedy, a
fake. The closer they came to the hour the call would
go out to audition, the more gaily they’d laugh, the
more spectacularly they’d wear a front of cheerful
vivacity. Tony had to be out for an hour in the afternoon,
and he met them alone. His smile, answering
theirs, became fixed, wooden. When Tony came back
he disappeared into the little room where a girl
checked spot announcements.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They seem to be awfully happy,” the girl said enviously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They seem to be,” Joe agreed.</p>

<p class='c010'>He knew better. And suddenly he knew why Mander,
borrowing fifty cents, had given him a wrench,
and why making the rounds after he was out of <i>Sue
Davis</i> had depressed him. All the glamour was worn
thin, and now the tarnish showed. He couldn’t take
it. Not this way. Not through the peep-hole on show
business that was called a producer’s office. He knew
why that was, too.</p>

<p class='c010'>Making the rounds, he had had only fleeting
glimpses. He had been a part of the tide, meeting it
as it passed and meeting it in fragments. But here
the whole tide came at him at once and overwhelmed
him. The laughter and the gay talk became vapor.
All he could see was the feverishness of hope, the
sharp thorns of anxiety and uncertainty. And they
were such fine people, so buoyant and so brave on
so little. Small-time radio! Dreaming a dream that
could never come true. Or, if it did come true, it
would be for only a few.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Joe,” Tony boomed. He had to go out. “The blue
slip,” said Tony, and handed him script. The blue
slip was the Everts-Hall rejection slip.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mander sauntered in, his hat on the back of his
head and his shoulders swaying. “Tony, wait until
you get this. I’m in a restaurant for a spot of lunch
and there’s an I Am boy at the next table. I’ll give
him to you.” Without make-up or props, Mander
gave an impersonation of a pop-off. He made it a
cameo, a sharply-etched portrait of a living character.
He was good.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought: “He must have rehearsed that for
hours.” The bread-and-butter hunt!</p>

<p class='c010'>Next day was <i>Bush-League Larry</i> day. With Tony
producing the show at FFOM, Joe again had to
meet the gay crowd alone. He tried to rise to it, to
meet them smile for smile. He knew some stories,
too. But Tony wasn’t there, and the fever of anxiety
made them restless. They didn’t stay long. “Tell Tony
I was in, Joe, will you?” Joe had a stock reply. “Too
bad you can’t wait.” He knew they wouldn’t wait and
spend unprofitable time with him. He wasn’t Tony;
he wasn’t casting this show. He saw the last of the
crowd leave and felt tired, weary.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All gone?” Tony boomed on his arrival. “I thought
they’d still be waiting. What a day! Thank God we
don’t have a new show come up every month.” He
took a cigar from his pocket and studied the boy.
“You don’t like it, Joe, do you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” said Joe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony’s voice had changed. “You get used to it. It’s
the system; it’s show business. Will they feel any
better if we slam the door on them and lock them
out? Anyway, we’re not guilty of sustaining. When
we put on a show we have a paid cast.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe said slowly: “How long before you’re used
to it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know,” Tony said in that same changed
voice. “I’ve been here only five years.” He went to
his desk, wrote for a while, and swung around with
a paper in his hands. “Last year I laid out more than
four hundred dollars in small loans. Most of it’s gone
for good. How are they going to pay back? Where
are they going to get it?” He held out the paper.
“Call these people in, Joe. We’ll start to audition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe, sitting at a telephone, went down the list of
calls. Mander at ten to-morrow morning, somebody
else at eleven, somebody else at noon. The list ran
two and one-half days. Fourteen actors and actresses
coming in—and only four parts. Waiting for a number
to answer, he thought of Tony with a stir of emotion.
This Tony who boomed and glad-handed wasn’t the
real Tony at all. The boom and the glad hand were
front. The real Tony was as soft-hearted as brooding
Vic Wylie.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mander arrived next morning at ten sharp. Joe
thought: “He’s dressed for the part.” Mander wore
a shriekingly loud tie, an exaggerated high collar,
and shoes glaringly yellow. Did this trick of dressing
like a small-town wise guy add anything to a reading?
Joe wondered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Greetings,” Tony boomed. “Waiting for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Considering what you’re going to get,” Mander
popped off, “you should have stayed awake all
night.” He looked toward Joe and made a blithe
motion with one hand. “A little music, Professor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony, chewing a cigar, mumbled cues, and Mander
read.</p>

<p class='c010'>And, while the reading went on, the elevators were
bringing show people to the reception-room, and the
girl at the desk was telling them that Tony was busy.
That was all they had to be told—they went away.
Soon the news would spread up and down Royal
Street that the Tony Vaux show was cast. By late
afternoon the Everts-Hall Agency would no longer
be a big stop.</p>

<p class='c010'>The reading ended. Tony lit a fresh cigar.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me hear it again, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A fine dew of sweat appeared on Mander’s forehead.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A little too much steam,” Tony said when the
second reading was finished. “Now, now.” Fat hands
spread out in a placating gesture. “Not bad; not bad
at all, Frank. But I’m thinking of the other characters.
They’re tense with drama. If you give me high comedy
I get too much contrast. No belly laughs, just
chuckles. Take it from ‘I don’t mean I’m the best
in the world—’ Page four.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was only a hair-line of change in Mander’s
reading, but the part shaded into an entirely different
part. This was what Wylie meant by a producer
touching the strings and producing vibrations. But
to give these vibrations, an actor had to be an actor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony beamed; Tony’s cigar moved from one side
of his mouth to the other. “A nice reading,” he said
genially. “It’s your part, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The dew was gone from Mander’s forehead. “How
about a twenty-five dollar advance, Tony? I’m in to
my landlady for six weeks. The old girl’s getting
peeved.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony chewed the cigar. “The office is starting to
get tough on advances. Can’t you tell her you’re
working?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m afraid,” Mander said lightly, “she’s heard that
one before.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony wrote an order on the cashier. Mander, passing
out, was a new man. Pop Bartell had been a new
man on two borrowed dollars.</p>

<p class='c010'>One by one actors and actresses came in to read.
Joe found this harder to bear than the parade of show
people making the rounds. On the rounds they accepted
the possibility of long, idle periods, but now
everything was crystallized into a single effort. A part
in a sponsored show that paid real money was won
or lost in a single hour, perhaps in the reading of a
single line. They laughed and jested, but the smiles
trembled under the heightened tension of nervousness
and strain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe found escape in the little room of spot announcements.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl tuned a station, checked her list, and
tuned another station. “I’d love to be out there listening,
Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess I’ve gone sour,” said Joe. He hadn’t meant
to say that. He was startled.</p>

<p class='c010'>The afternoon brought quiet. Tony was at FFOM
and the last of the <i>Poisoned Fangs</i> auditions would
be held to-morrow. It seemed to Joe that it was weeks
since he had heard <i>Bush-League Larry</i>. With the
office echoing with laughter and gag the radio had
not been touched. He tuned in FFOM and waited
for the show to come on.</p>

<p class='c010'>His mind wandered. Archie Munn and Lucille
Borden. He never heard Lu’s show any more. Amby
Carver and Sonny Baker. He hadn’t seen Sonny since
the afternoon of Lu’s premier. Tony rehearsed at the
studio and paid off at the studio; the cast never came
to the office. Amby had fawned, but Sonny would
have remained unchanged. Sonny would always be
the whole world to Sonny. Vic Wylie telling him he
couldn’t act....</p>

<p class='c010'>He stiffened. <i>Bush-League Larry</i> was on. Good
Lord, could that be Pop Bartell?</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Pop. But this was a Pop who murdered
lines, who fumbled, who didn’t seem to know what
to say or how to say it. Character? There was no
character. Any ham could have read the part better.
Joe shuddered and turned a knob quickly. The office
was silent. What, he wondered bleakly, had become
of the grand old trouper who needed only a word
of suggestion to tinge a part with a new color and
new harmonies?</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony Vaux came back from FFOM an hour past
his usual time. To-day no booming greeting to the
girl at the reception-desk announced his arrival. “I
thought you’d be gone, Joe.” He took some papers
from his pocket and, preoccupied, tapped them
against the other hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ve been waiting for you,” Joe said. “I heard the
show—part of it. Why don’t you make Pop wear
glasses?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s not glasses, Joe. He’s been wearing glasses
before the mike since the show went on the air.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sonny’s pulling his old trick of stealing the show.
Pop follows script faithfully. Sonny reads a cue line
and Pop starts to come in. But Sonny ad libs an
extra line or two and Pop is left floundering. He
never knows whether to come in or to wait. Years
ago he’d have handled Sonny, but now he’s too old
for that kind of rough-and-tumble. He’s cracking
wide open. He’s lost. He’s shot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe trembled. “Are you standing for that, Tony?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m not Vic Wylie,” Tony said with bitter regret.
“Vic answers to nobody but himself. If he wanted
to give Sonny the hook, he’d give it to him. I’m a
salaried employee. They give me a script; they expect
a production. Pop’s a stooge in this show;
Sonny’s the star. Suppose I go after Sonny the way
Vic did? How long will I have a show? How long
before they’ll have me on the carpet inside? Am I a
producer? Then what’s wrong with me? Why don’t
I produce? That’s the only question they ask. Why
don’t I produce a show?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Stenographers and office clerks were on their way
home; an orchestra of feet shuffled and tapped along
the corridor leading to the elevators.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This can’t go on,” Joe cried in protest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It isn’t going to go on. The He people caught me
at FFOM; I had to get over there at once.” He
opened a drawer of his desk and dropped in the
paper he had been tapping against his hand. “Pop’s
out,” he said roughly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe couldn’t speak.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Curt must write in a new character and thin Pop’s
lines. Thinner and thinner. Friday week he’ll be out
of the show. Finished. Call him in for two o’clock
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A one-word hammer beat against Joe’s mind. Even
small-time radio would have no place for a veteran
who murdered a part. Finished!</p>

<p class='c010'>He dreaded to-morrow, but to-morrow came. He
dreaded the passing of the morning hours, but they
passed. Out in the city the noon whistles blew. After
that, time was a racing despair.</p>

<p class='c010'>Youthfully slim and gallant, Pop Bartell was with
them. “Good afternoon, Tony. Good afternoon, Joe.
A beautiful day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony did not try to beam. “Pop, I’m afraid I have
bad news. The He people want the <i>Larry</i> show
jazzed. They think the action’s too slow and want
more bang-bang.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The old trouper took the news without blinking.
“Is that definite, Tony?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m afraid so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you think that’s bad news? Tony, my boy,
you’re doing me a favor.” Pop coughed. “A very great
favor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe thought dismally: “Front. He knew this was
coming.” The boy’s throat was in a vise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Something else will turn up, Pop,” Tony said.
“As a matter of fact, we have a platter—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe knew there wasn’t a platter in the cabinet that
had a possible old-man part.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tut, tut, Tony. Something has turned up.” Pop
was actually twinkling. “As a matter of fact, this relieves
me from a distressing predicament. I was going
to ask you for my release if you could let me go
without putting the show in a hole. I have friends in
Cleveland and there’s a part coming up. To be exact,
it has come up. A character part that’s a lead. Something
of a tear-jerker—<i>Sunset of Life</i>. The part’s waiting
for me. How soon could I be released?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Friday week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is providential, Tony. They’d like me to be
at Cleveland Saturday week. Actually providential.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s heart lifted. This couldn’t be front. This was
too real, too sincere.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tony had his hat and coat; Tony was booming
again. “Then everything’s jake, Pop? I’m auditioning
a specialty for the Sunday night variety. If I’m not
back by five, Joe, run along. I’ll be seeing you, Pop.”
Tony was gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>The lift in Joe’s heart became song. “Mr. Bartell,
that’s swell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All but the ride to Cleveland,” Pop Bartell said
whimsically. “I had ten years of one-night stands,
Joe; I could live happily without ever seeing a railroad.
In case I don’t get over this way again”—his
hand made a sweep—“<i>au revoir</i>, Joe, and lots of
good luck.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Send me your notices,” Joe said eagerly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“From what I’ve been told, Joe, this new show
should get some nice notices. Some very nice
notices.” Youthful and light of step the veteran
walked out of the office.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe Carlin’s lips were parted in breathless exultation.
Kicked out of one show and stepping right into
another. Oh, but this was grand! This was one of
those moments that paid for the heartache of the
bread-and-butter hunt. Without warning the strain
of the day took its toll and his nerves were limp and
ragged. He went to the cooler, but water was flat.
What he needed was a quick pick-up, coffee hot and
strong. He went along the corridor through which
Tony and Pop had preceded him and paused at the
reception-desk. “I’ll be back in five min—” His voice
went dead.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pop Bartell stood near the elevators staring into
vacancy.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mouth of the girl at the desk opened to ask
a question and Joe touched her arm for silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Abruptly Pop roused from his abstraction and
stepped toward the elevators. There was no change
in his jaunty, youthful stride. He touched a button.
A down light flashed and he moved over toward the
indicated door. And then, in the interval of waiting,
a quick, sick change took place in him. Suddenly he
seemed to shrink and to sag. His coat wrinkled like
an old coat across the shoulders, and his head
drooped as though there was no longer strength to
hold it upright. An elevator stopped, and he entered
it with a faltering, uncertain step. All in an instant he
was a beaten, broken, hopeless old man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What did you say, Mr. Carlin?” the girl asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing,” Joe said hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c010'>He went back to Tony’s office. So it had been front,
the pathetically brave front of show business. Poor
old Pop! A languidly contemptuous climber had
thrust him aside as a relic, and this is what he came
to after forty years of gallant trouping. This was
show business. And making the rounds was show
business, and washing out your only shirt and hanging
it to dry overnight was show business, and
Lucille Borden eating out her heart behind a Munson
counter was show business. Radio small-time!
Hunger and uncertainty!</p>

<p class='c010'>He sat at Tony’s desk and thought of the day Vic
Wylie had told him he’d see things that would make
him want to cry. The telephone rang fitfully and he
made note of the calls on Tony’s desk pad. A clock
whirred the five o’clock signal and Tony had not
returned.</p>

<p class='c010'>Slowly, his lips stiff, Joe took a pen from his pocket,
wrote a note, and left it on the desk:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Dear Tony</span>: Pop was fronting; he cracked
after he left here. You’ve been swell to me,
but this isn’t my game. I’ll be through next
Saturday. I’m sorry.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Joe</span></p>

<p class='c013'>He pushed back the chair and stood in thought
beside the desk. As slowly as he had taken the pen
from his pocket he reached for the telephone and
called Vic Wylie’s office.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you give Vic a message for me, Miss Robb?
We’ve been auditioning a cast and—I guess I can’t
take it. Tell him Pop Bartell’s been dropped from the
<i>Larry</i> show. I’m throwing up my job.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Robb was dumfounded. “Tony told us he was
pleased with you....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know,” Joe said wearily. “Vic’ll understand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Office buildings were emptying, and Royal Street
was a packed, shuffling, slow-moving canyon. Joe
moved along with the mass until he came to the
Thomas Carlin store. It was almost the closing hour,
and a lone customer waited for a clerk to wrap a
purchase. The lights were on and facets of radiance
gleamed from the polished glass of show-cases and
the polished wood of shelves. To-day Joe saw the
scene with a vision that had been cleaned and
washed—its bright cleanliness, its subdued brilliance
of display, its subtle breath of pride and courtesy
and alertness. The faces of all the clerks—strange that
he had never noticed them before: friendly faces
that were not merely a friendly front. The lone customer
left. “Hi, Joe.” The clerks grinned at him. “Hi,
boys.” He grinned at them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some new books came in to-day, Joe,” Mr. Fairchild
announced.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not now,” said Joe. He added an explanation.
“Something on my mind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No!” Mr. Fairchild prodded his ribs. “They’ll toss
you out of the Jitterbug Union for that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It wasn’t a brilliant gag. As a gag, it would have
been scorned by any actor making the rounds. But
it was good; it was homey.</p>

<p class='c010'>The store closed, and Joe walked with his father
to the parking lot. The man pushed the key into the
ignition lock and reached his foot for the starter
button.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it, Joe? Trouble?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not exactly.” Joe was still thinking of Pop Bartell.
“I’m through at the agency. I’d like to come into the
store.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin’s foot did not touch the button. Horns
honked and cars backed out of symmetrical lines as
an attendant directed parking-lot traffic. Silence,
brittle and strange, lingered in the Carlin sedan.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I—I thought you’d be glad,” Joe said uncertainly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is that your reason for telling me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy was startled. “Don’t you want me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin stepped on the button. The attendant
waved an arm and he shook his head. The motor
idled, warming.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When you told me you wanted to be an actor,”
the man said as though he debated each word, “I let
you have your fling. Was there anything else for me
to do? I was afraid of making you a round peg in a
square hole. You failed as an actor. But you still
stayed in show business and turned to production.
That’s the rub, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What?” Joe demanded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me put it this way: After you’d failed—don’t
get the idea I’m rubbing that in; as I told you, I
made a miserable failure of my first job—had you
come to me after that first failure, I’d have welcomed
you instantly. A lot of persons change their first
desires. I couldn’t ask for a better man than Fairchild;
he started out to be a mechanical engineer. But
you made show business both your first and second
choices. You’ve made the store a very bad third
choice. You leave the impression that you’re coming
to me now because there’s no place else to go. That
doesn’t set so well, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s nerves were raw from a day of chafing, and
this disappointment was crushing. “You mean I
needn’t come around?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t say that. I’ll have to think this over. I’m
trying to see the situation from your angle as well
as from my own. What will it benefit you in the long
run to use the business as a door of escape? If you
come to the store as a place of last resort, you’re
still a round peg in a square hole. It might be better
for you to get a job on your own and try yourself
out in somebody else’s business. For a while, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Disappointment and raw nerves united to make
the boy stiff with anger. “All right, Dad, if that’s
how you want it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That isn’t how I want it,” Tom Carlin said. “That’s
how it seems to be.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They said little more to each other on the ride
out to the Northend. But they were talking as they
entered the house, and talk was a lively stream
around the dinner table. Front, Joe thought, wasn’t
confined to show business; you could wear a front
at home. The meal over, he found that morning’s
<i>Journal</i> and went to his room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Something that was part of this house worked its
spell. His jagged nerves relaxed and anger died in
him. He began to see his father’s point of view. He
hadn’t been absolutely denied the store; it was simply
that his father questioned the wisdom of having
him come in now. After all, there was a lot to what
his father had said. He <i>had</i> made the store a third
choice. He must look like an irresponsible madcap, a
harum-scarum who didn’t know his own mind. Well,
he’d have to prove himself. He could do that. He’d
find an outside job and make good at it. Then, after
a year or two ... but a year or two seemed so long.</p>

<p class='c010'>He opened the <i>Journal</i> and studied the <i>Help
Wanted</i> columns. Christmas was approaching and all
the large stores along Royal Street were clamoring
for packers, sales people, delivery men, and cashiers.
He could probably get a seasonal job at half a dozen
places; certainly, if you rolled up your sleeves and
pitched in, temporary employment might become
permanent employment. But he couldn’t, he thought
with a fresh pang, get a job with his own father.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a tap on the door and Tom Carlin
walked in. “Joe, Mother thinks I may have been
hasty. Her reactions are usually right. You’ve heard
what I have to say, but I haven’t heard your side. Do
you mind telling me why you were fired?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe stared. “Fired? I wasn’t fired. What gave you
that idea? I quit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man reached for a chair, took a pipe from his
pocket, and sat down slowly. “Why did you quit?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe tried to tell him. The story used up a great
many words, and he felt that he was telling it badly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I might have made a good producer. Vic thought
I would and Tony told Vic I was doing well. But if
I became a producer I’d always be meeting the sordid
side of show business. All I’d see would be men
and women wearing an artificial front. They’d make
me a big stop when I had a show coming up. They’d
stay awake nights planning to catch my attention as
Mander caught Tony’s. They’d audition and try to
hide how much a part meant to them. I don’t mean
there isn’t struggle and uncertainty in every other
line, but—oh, show business is different. I’d know
too much about small time. I’d see too much: little
corners of shabbiness, things that were mean and
grubby, fine people trying to hide worry and apprehension
behind a front. You get so you hate a front.
I’d know they were getting hard knocks to-day and
would get the same hard knocks to-morrow. I’d know
that probably only one in a thousand would ever
make the big time, just as I couldn’t make it and for
the same reason. They’re good, but not good enough.
Good enough for small time, and sustaining shows
that pay no salaries, but only good enough for that.
It got under my skin and did something to me. I
used to turn on a radio, and listen to a show, and
think it was all glamorous; there’s very little glamour
in show business when you get behind the scenes.
You see too many of the wounds.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin filled his pipe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And then, to-day, Pop Bartell. That finished me.
Sooner or later I’d have been finished, anyway. Vic
says I feel too much. Maybe he’s right. I’m not sorry
I tried show business. If I hadn’t, I’d probably always
feel I’d thrown away a chance to see my name
up in lights.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Smoke was a thick cloud around Tom Carlin’s
head. “Joe, I apologize for what I said in the car. I
didn’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does what I told you make a difference?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All the difference in the world. Instead of being
up in lights, your name will some day be on a store
window.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean I’m going into the store—now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Any time you’re ready.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe had never known it was possible to feel so
good. “I’ll be ready Monday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin knocked ashes from his pipe and refilled
the bowl. “I found a script in your bureau, Joe,”
he said serenely.</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe sat up straight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had copies made and brought the script back.
I saw no use talking to you until I had something to
talk about. I wrote to five publishers—four in New
York and one in Boston. Three are willing to pay a
fair share of the cost on a dramatization of their
books. One is doubtful, and one is definitely unfavorable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe’s voice was eager. “Are we going on the air?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man caught that “we.” “I’m more than half
convinced we’ll have a Carlin show next September.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe went hot and cold. Not because this was radio,
but because it was <i>Thomas Carlin Presents</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom Carlin puffed his contentment. “Every day
we have customers who telephone and ask to have
some purchase delivered at once. That forces me to
take a clerk from behind the counter and send him
out. I’ve been thinking of hiring somebody to take
care of some light work and make these deliveries.
This Pop Bartell. Do you think he could fit into that
job after forty years of show business?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Joe was hot and cold again. “After what happened
to-day, Dad, he’d think somebody had given him
a piece of Heaven.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Send him in to see me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps,” said Joe, “I’ll run over a little later to
where he lives. He’ll sleep better to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After that they sat together in understanding
silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>A light step sounded in the hall and the door was
pushed open timidly. Kate Carlin stood on the
threshold. Her eyes, clouded with concern, went
from her husband to her son and back to her husband
again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come in, Kate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly her eyes were clear. She smiled. “This is
a night you’ve looked forward to, Tom, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.” He held out his hand to her. “Come in, Kate,
and sit with us. Carlin and Son are in conference.”</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
